Traditional MIA obtains feature of target model via shadow models and uses the feature to train attack model, but the scale and complexity of training or fine-tuning data for large language model (LLM)-based recommendation systems make shadow models difficult to construct. Knowledge distillation as a method for extracting knowledge contributes to construct a stronger reference model. Knowledge distillation enables separate distillation for member and non-member data during the distillation process, enhancing the model's discriminative capability between the two in MIA. This paper propose a knowledge distillation-based MIA paradigm to improve the performance of membership inference attacks on LLM-based recommendation systems. Our paradigm introduces knowledge distillation to obtain a reference model, which enhances the reference model's ability to distinguish between member and non-member data. We obtain individual features from the reference model and train our attack model with fused feature. Our paradigm improves the attack performance of MIA compared to shadow model-based attack.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdbLLM\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f71\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u9700\u8981\u6784\u5efa\u5f71\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u83b7\u53d6\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46LLM\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4f7f\u5f97\u5f71\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u3002\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u53d6\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u84b8\u998f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5206\u522b\u5bf9\u6210\u5458\u548c\u975e\u6210\u5458\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e24\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u4ece\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u83b7\u53d6\u4e2a\u4f53\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u878d\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u8bad\u7ec3\u653b\u51fb\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f71\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u8303\u5f0f\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u8303\u5f0f\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347LLM\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5f71\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Customers increasingly shop across multiple devices, from voice-only assistants to multimodal displays, each offering different input and output capabilities. A proactive suggestion to switch devices can greatly improve the user experience, but it must be offered with high precision to avoid unnecessary friction. We address the challenge of predicting when a query requires visual augmentation and a cross-device switch to improve product discovery. We introduce Image-Seeking Intent Prediction, a novel task for LLM-driven e-commerce assistants that anticipates when a spoken product query should proactively trigger a visual on a screen-enabled device. Using large-scale production data from a multi-device retail assistant, including 900K voice queries, associated product retrievals, and behavioral signals such as image carousel engagement, we train IRP (Image Request Predictor), a model that leverages user input query and corresponding retrieved product metadata to anticipate visual intent. Our experiments show that combining query semantics with product data, particularly when improved through lightweight summarization, consistently improves prediction accuracy. Incorporating a differentiable precision-oriented loss further reduces false positives. These results highlight the potential of LLMs to power intelligent, cross-device shopping assistants that anticipate and adapt to user needs, enabling more seamless and personalized e-commerce experiences.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u641c\u7d22\u610f\u56fe\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5IRP\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u8bed\u97f3\u67e5\u8be2\u662f\u5426\u9700\u8981\u89c6\u89c9\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u8de8\u8bbe\u5907\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7535\u5546\u8d2d\u7269\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7528\u6237\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u8d2d\u7269\uff0c\u4e3b\u52a8\u5efa\u8bae\u5207\u6362\u5230\u89c6\u89c9\u8bbe\u5907\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u4ea7\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3IRP\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u4ea7\u54c1\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6458\u8981\u548c\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5bfc\u5411\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u4ea7\u54c1\u6570\u636e\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6458\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u540e\uff09\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5bfc\u5411\u635f\u5931\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u62a5\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u9a71\u52a8\u667a\u80fd\u8de8\u8bbe\u5907\u8d2d\u7269\u52a9\u624b\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u7528\u6237\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u65e0\u7f1d\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u7535\u5546\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002"}}

Unlike conventional Large Language Models (LLMs), which are constrained by static training corpora, RAG-powered systems dynamically integrate domain-specific external knowledge sources, thereby overcoming temporal and disciplinary limitations. In this study, we present the design and evaluation of a RAG-enabled system tailored for Mycophyto, with a focus on advancing agricultural applications related to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). These fungi play a critical role in sustainable agriculture by enhancing nutrient acquisition, improving plant resilience under abiotic and biotic stresses, and contributing to soil health. Our system operationalizes a dual-layered strategy: (i) semantic retrieval and augmentation of domain-specific content from agronomy and biotechnology corpora using vector embeddings, and (ii) structured data extraction to capture predefined experimental metadata such as inoculation methods, spore densities, soil parameters, and yield outcomes. This hybrid approach ensures that generated responses are not only semantically aligned but also supported by structured experimental evidence. To support scalability, embeddings are stored in a high-performance vector database, allowing near real-time retrieval from an evolving literature base. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed pipeline retrieves and synthesizes highly relevant information regarding AMF interactions with crop systems, such as tomato (Solanum lycopersicum).

While recent methods have advanced multimodal representation learning, most implicitly assume modality equivalence or treat modalities in a largely uniform manner, still relying on generic fusion paradigms. This often results in indiscriminate incorporation of multimodal signals and insufficient control over task-irrelevant redundancy, which may in turn limit generalization. We revisit MIE from a task-centric view: text should dominate, vision should selectively support. We present OTCR, a two-stage framework. First, Cross-modal Optimal Transport (OT) yields sparse, probabilistic alignments between text tokens and visual patches, with a context-aware gate controlling visual injection. Second, a Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) compresses fused features, filtering task-irrelevant noise to produce compact, task-adaptive representations.

However, most systems are optimized solely for engagement metrics, such as click rate, viewing time, or scrolling, without accounting for users' emotional states. Repeated exposure to emotionally charged content has been shown to negatively affect users' emotional well-being over time. We propose an Emotion-aware Social Media Recommendation (ESMR) framework that personalizes content based on users' evolving emotional trajectories. ESMR integrates a Transformer-based emotion predictor with a hybrid recommendation policy: a LightGBM model for engagement during stable periods and a reinforcement learning agent with causally informed rewards when negative emotional states persist. Through behaviorally grounded evaluation over 30-day interaction traces, ESMR demonstrates improved emotional recovery, reduced volatility, and strong engagement retention.

We present LiveCLKTBench, an automated generation pipeline specifically designed to isolate and measure cross-lingual knowledge transfer. Our pipeline identifies self-contained, time-sensitive knowledge entities from real-world domains, filters them based on temporal occurrence, and verifies them against the model's knowledge. The documents of these valid entities are then used to generate factual questions, which are translated into multiple languages to evaluate transferability across linguistic boundaries. Using LiveCLKTBench, we evaluate several LLMs across five languages and observe that cross-lingual transfer is strongly influenced by linguistic distance and often asymmetric across language directions. While larger models improve transfer, the gains diminish with scale and vary across domains.

The effectiveness of RAG depends significantly on aligning the number of retrieved documents with query characteristics: narrowly focused queries typically require fewer, highly relevant documents, whereas broader or ambiguous queries benefit from retrieving more extensive supporting information. However, the common static top-k retrieval approach fails to adapt to this variability, resulting in either insufficient context from too few documents or redundant information from too many. Motivated by these challenges, we introduce Cluster-based Adaptive Retrieval (CAR), an algorithm that dynamically determines the optimal number of documents by analyzing the clustering patterns of ordered query-document similarity distances. CAR detects the transition point within similarity distances, where tightly clustered, highly relevant documents shift toward less pertinent candidates, establishing an adaptive cut-off that scales with query complexity. On Coinbase's CDP corpus and the public MultiHop-RAG benchmark, CAR consistently picks the optimal retrieval depth and achieves the highest TES score, outperforming every fixed top-k baseline. In downstream RAG evaluations, CAR cuts LLM token usage by 60%, trims end-to-end latency by 22%, and reduces hallucinations by 10% while fully preserving answer relevance.

Understanding and steering this internal behavior is key both for trustworthy deployment and for scientific interpretability of model mechanisms. We introduce COMPASS (Context-Modulated PID Attention Steering System), a lightweight, interpretable control framework that embeds a model-based feedback loop directly within decoding. COMPASS quantifies context reliance via a transparent metric, the Context Reliance Score (CRS), which serves as an online probe of how attention heads ground generation in evidence. Using this interpretable signal, a PID controller dynamically modulates attention heads to maintain factual consistency without retraining or multi-pass decoding. Across benchmarks (HotpotQA, XSum, HaluEval, RAGTruth), COMPASS consistently reduces contextual hallucination rates (2.8 to 5.8 percent absolute) while revealing how distinct attention heads contribute to evidence alignment.

Although speech synthesis systems have made significant progress in generating natural and intelligible speech, primarily through architectures that implicitly model prosodic features such as pitch, intensity, and duration, the construction of datasets with explicit prosodic segmentation and their impact on spontaneous speech synthesis remains largely unexplored. This paper evaluates the effects of manual and automatic prosodic segmentation annotations in Brazilian Portuguese on the quality of speech synthesized by a non-autoregressive model, FastSpeech 2. Experimental results show that training with prosodic segmentation produced slightly more intelligible and acoustically natural speech. While automatic segmentation tends to create more regular segments, manual prosodic segmentation introduces greater variability, which contributes to more natural prosody. Analysis of neutral declarative utterances showed that both training approaches reproduced the expected nuclear accent pattern, but the prosodic model aligned more closely with natural pre-nuclear contours.

Existing systems rely on CPU-based ANN indexing and filtering services, suffering from non-negligible costs and forgoing joint optimization opportunities. Such inefficiency makes them difficult to support more complex model architectures, such as learned similarities and multi-task retrieval.\n  In this paper, we propose SilverTorch, a model-based system for serving recommendation models on GPUs. SilverTorch unifies model serving by replacing standalone indexing and filtering services with layers of served models. We propose a Bloom index algorithm on GPUs for feature filtering and a tensor-native fused Int8 ANN kernel on GPUs for nearest neighbor search. We further co-design the ANN search index and filtering index to reduce GPU memory utilization and eliminate unnecessary computation. Benefit from SilverTorch's serving paradigm, we introduce a OverArch scoring layer and a Value Model to aggregate results across multi-tasks. These advancements improve the accuracy for retrieval and enable future studies for serving more complex models.

This approach relies on quantized representations to discretize item features, modeling users' historical interactions as sequences of discrete tokens. Based on these tokenized sequences, GR predicts the next item by employing next-token prediction methods. The challenges of GR lie in constructing high-quality semantic identifiers (IDs) that are hierarchically organized, minimally conflicting, and conducive to effective generative model training. However, current approaches remain limited in their ability to harness multimodal information and to capture the deep and intricate interactions among diverse modalities, both of which are essential for learning high-quality semantic IDs and for effectively training GR models. To address this, we propose Multi-Aspect Cross-modal quantization for generative Recommendation (MACRec), which introduces multimodal information and incorporates it into both semantic ID learning and generative model training from different aspects. Specifically, we first introduce cross-modal quantization during the ID learning process, which effectively reduces conflict rates and thus improves codebook usability through the complementary integration of multimodal information. In addition, to further enhance the generative ability of our GR model, we incorporate multi-aspect cross-modal alignments, including the implicit and explicit alignments.

While the latter has limitations in model performance and generalization, deep learning (DL) has achieved improvement, especially on semantic relationship capturing with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The aim of the study is to enhance opinion mining by introducing a hybrid deep neural network model that combines a bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BGRU) and long short-term memory (LSTM) layers to improve sentiment analysis, particularly addressing challenges such as contextual nuance, scalability, and class imbalance. To substantiate the efficacy of the proposed model, we conducted comprehensive experiments utilizing benchmark datasets, encompassing IMDB movie critiques and Amazon product evaluations. The introduced hybrid BGRULSTM (HBGRU-LSTM) architecture attained a testing accuracy of 95%, exceeding the performance of traditional DL frameworks such as LSTM (93.06%), CNN+LSTM (93.31%), and GRU+LSTM (92.20%).

In this work, we propose ItemRAG, an item-based RAG method for LLM-based recommendation that retrieves relevant items (rather than users) from item-item co-purchase histories. ItemRAG helps LLMs capture co-purchase patterns among items, which are beneficial for recommendations. Especially, our retrieval strategy incorporates semantically similar items to better handle cold-start items and uses co-purchase frequencies to improve the relevance of the retrieved items.

To mitigate attention-level compression, HTP partitions the input into blocks and prepends block-level summary tokens to subsequent blocks, creating multiple pathways for backward information flow. To address readout-level over-squashing, we replace last-token pooling with mean-pooling, a choice supported by theoretical analysis.

By leveraging prior estimates of proficiency to select questions and updating the estimates iteratively based on responses, CAT enables personalized learner modeling and has attracted substantial attention. Despite this progress, most existing works focus primarily on improving diagnostic accuracy, while overlooking the selection bias inherent in the adaptive process. Selection Bias arises because the question selection is strongly influenced by the estimated proficiency, such as assigning easier questions to learners with lower proficiency and harder ones to learners with higher proficiency. Since the selection depends on prior estimation, this bias propagates into the diagnosis model, which is further amplified during iterative updates, leading to misalignment and biased predictions. Moreover, the imbalanced nature of learners' historical interactions often exacerbates the bias in diagnosis models. To address this issue, we propose a debiasing framework consisting of two key modules: Cross-Attribute Examinee Retrieval and Selective Mixup-based Regularization. First, we retrieve balanced examinees with relatively even distributions of correct and incorrect responses and use them as neutral references for biased examinees.

However, most existing approaches fail to capture how students' knowledge evolves dynamically across their proficiencies, conceptual gaps, and forgetting patterns. This challenge is particularly acute in mathematics tutoring, where effective instruction requires fine-grained scaffolding precisely calibrated to each student's mastery level and cognitive retention. To address this issue, we propose TASA (Teaching According to Students' Aptitude), a student-aware tutoring framework that integrates persona, memory, and forgetting dynamics for personalized mathematics learning. Specifically, TASA maintains a structured student persona capturing proficiency profiles and an event memory recording prior learning interactions. By incorporating a continuous forgetting curve with knowledge tracing, TASA dynamically updates each student's mastery state and generates contextually appropriate, difficulty-calibrated questions and explanations.

However, most industrial systems adopt a self-reinforcing training pipeline that relies on historically exposed user interactions for supervision. This paradigm inevitably leads to a filter bubble effect, where potentially relevant but previously unseen content is excluded from the training signal, biasing the model toward narrow and conservative retrieval. In this paper, we present CroPS (Cross-Perspective Positive Samples), a novel retrieval data engine designed to alleviate this problem by introducing diverse and semantically meaningful positive examples from multiple perspectives. CroPS enhances training with positive signals derived from user query reformulation behavior (query-level), engagement data in recommendation streams (system-level), and world knowledge synthesized by large language models (knowledge-level). To effectively utilize these heterogeneous signals, we introduce a Hierarchical Label Assignment (HLA) strategy and a corresponding H-InfoNCE loss that together enable fine-grained, relevance-aware optimization. Extensive experiments conducted on Kuaishou Search, a large-scale commercial short-video search platform, demonstrate that CroPS significantly outperforms strong baselines both offline and in live A/B tests, achieving superior retrieval performance and reducing query reformulation rates. CroPS is now fully deployed in Kuaishou Search, serving hundreds of millions of users daily.", "AI": {"tldr": "CroPS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6570\u636e\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u67e5\u8be2\u7ea7\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ea7\u4e09\u4e2a\u89c6\u89d2\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6b63\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5bc6\u96c6\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6c14\u6ce1\u6548\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4e1a\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u5386\u53f2\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6c14\u6ce1\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u6392\u9664\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u4f46\u672a\u88ab\u66dd\u5149\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u5411\u4fdd\u5b88\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCroPS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u4e09\u4e2a\u89c6\u89d2\u83b7\u53d6\u6b63\u6837\u672c\uff1a\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u91cd\u6784\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u67e5\u8be2\u7ea7\uff09\u3001\u63a8\u8350\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u6570\u636e\uff08\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\uff09\u3001LLM\u5408\u6210\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ea7\uff09\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u548cH-InfoNCE\u635f\u5931\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5feb\u624b\u641c\u7d22\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cCroPS\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u548c\u5728\u7ebfA/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u67e5\u8be2\u91cd\u6784\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "CroPS\u6210\u529f\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6c14\u6ce1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5df2\u5728\u5feb\u624b\u641c\u7d22\u5e73\u53f0\u5168\u9762\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u4ebf\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u65e5\u5e38\u670d\u52a1\u3002"}}

As multilingual Vision-Language Models (VLMs) gain prominence, robust evaluation methodologies are essential to drive progress toward equitable AI for low-resource languages. Current multilingual VLM evaluations suffer from four major limitations: reliance on unverified auto-translations, narrow task/domain coverage, limited sample sizes, and lack of cultural and natively sourced Question-Answering (QA). To address these gaps, we present a scalable framework to evaluate VLMs in Indian languages and compare it with performance in English. Using the framework, we generate HinTel-AlignBench, a benchmark that draws from diverse sources in Hindi and Telugu with English-aligned samples. Our contributions are threefold: (1) a semi-automated dataset creation framework combining back-translation, filtering, and human verification; (2) the most comprehensive vision-language benchmark for Hindi and and Telugu, including adapted English datasets (VQAv2, RealWorldQA, CLEVR-Math) and native novel Indic datasets (JEE for STEM, VAANI for cultural grounding) with approximately 4,000 QA pairs per language; and (3) a detailed performance analysis of various State-of-the-Art (SOTA) open-weight and closed-source VLMs. We find a regression in performance for tasks in English versus in Indian languages for 4 out of 5 tasks across all the models, with an average regression of 8.3 points in Hindi and 5.5 points for Telugu.

We provide the first comprehensive study grounding ID in interpretable text properties through cross-encoder analysis, linguistic features, and sparse autoencoders (SAEs). In this work, we establish three key findings. First, ID is complementary to entropy-based metrics: after controlling for length, the two are uncorrelated, with ID capturing geometric complexity orthogonal to prediction quality. Second, ID exhibits robust genre stratification: scientific prose shows low ID (~8), encyclopedic content medium ID (~9), and creative/opinion writing high ID (~10.5) across all models tested. This reveals that contemporary LLMs find scientific text \"representationally simple\" while fiction requires additional degrees of freedom. Third, using SAEs, we identify causal features: scientific signals (formal tone, report templates, statistics) reduce ID; humanized signals (personalization, emotion, narrative) increase it. Steering experiments confirm these effects are causal. Thus, for contemporary models, scientific writing appears comparatively \"easy\", whereas fiction, opinion, and affect add representational degrees of freedom. Our multi-faceted analysis provides practical guidance for the proper use of ID and the sound interpretation of ID-based results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5206\u6790\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5168\u9762\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5185\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6587\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0ID\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u6307\u6807\u4e92\u8865\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u4f53\u88c1\u5206\u5c42\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5f71\u54cdID\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u5185\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u662f\u73b0\u4ee3LLM\u5206\u6790\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6587\u672c\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\u4ecd\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\u6765\u7406\u89e3ID\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4ea4\u53c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5206\u6790\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAEs\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u957f\u5ea6\u53d8\u91cf\u548c\u8f6c\u5411\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "result": "1.

This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication", "summary": "Trained on diverse human-authored texts, Large Language Models (LLMs) unlocked the potential for Creative Natural Language Generation (CNLG), benefiting various applications like advertising and storytelling. Nevertheless, CNLG still remains difficult due to two main challenges. (1) Multi-objective flexibility: user requirements are often personalized, fine-grained, and pluralistic, which LLMs struggle to satisfy simultaneously; (2) Interpretive complexity: beyond generation, creativity also involves understanding and interpreting implicit meaning to enhance users' perception. These challenges significantly limit current methods, especially in short-form text generation, in generating creative and insightful content. To address this, we focus on Chinese baby naming, a representative short-form CNLG task requiring adherence to explicit user constraints (e.g., length, semantics, anthroponymy) while offering meaningful aesthetic explanations. We propose NAMeGEn, a novel multi-agent optimization framework that iteratively alternates between objective extraction, name generation, and evaluation to meet diverse requirements and generate accurate explanations. To support this task, we further construct a classical Chinese poetry corpus with 17k+ poems to enhance aesthetics, and introduce CBNames, a new benchmark with tailored metrics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NAMeGEn effectively generates creative names that meet diverse, personalized requirements while providing meaningful explanations, outperforming six baseline methods spanning various LLM backbones without any training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86NAMEGEn\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u4e2d\u6587\u8d77\u540d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u590d\u6742\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u521b\u610f\u59d3\u540d\u53ca\u7f8e\u5b66\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u521b\u610f\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff1a(1) \u591a\u76ee\u6807\u7075\u6d3b\u6027 - \u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u7528\u6237\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u548c\u591a\u5143\u5316\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff1b(2) \u89e3\u91ca\u590d\u6742\u6027 - \u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u9690\u542b\u610f\u4e49\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u7528\u6237\u611f\u77e5\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u5728\u77ed\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNAMEGEn\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76ee\u6807\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u59d3\u540d\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u4ea4\u66ff\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6765\u6ee1\u8db3\u591a\u6837\u5316\u9700\u6c42\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b17k+\u9996\u53e4\u8bd7\u7684\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u7f8e\u5b66\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165CBNames\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cNAMEGEn\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u6ee1\u8db3\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u521b\u610f\u59d3\u540d\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u4f55\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u516d\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u9aa8\u5e72\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "NAMEGEn\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u77ed\u6587\u672c\u521b\u610f\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u590d\u6742\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u4e2d\u6587\u8d77\u540d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e3a\u521b\u610f\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Recently, DeepSeek-OCR conducted research into the feasibility of Contexts Optical Compression and achieved preliminary results. Inspired by this, we introduce Context Cascade Compression C3 to explore the upper limits of text compression. Our method cascades two LLMs of different sizes to handle the compression and decoding tasks. Specifically, a small LLM, acting as the first stage, performs text compression by condensing a long context into a set of latent tokens (e.g., 32 or 64 in length), achieving a high ratio of text tokens to latent tokens. A large LLM, as the second stage, then executes the decoding task on this compressed context. Experiments show that at a 20x compression ratio (where the number of text tokens is 20 times the number of latent tokens), our model achieves 98% decoding accuracy, compared to approximately 60% for DeepSeek-OCR. When we further increase the compression ratio to 40x, the accuracy is maintained at around 93%. This indicates that in the domain of context compression, C3 Compression demonstrates superior performance and feasibility over optical character compression. C3 uses a simpler, pure-text pipeline that ignores factors like layout, color, and information loss from a visual encoder. This also suggests a potential upper bound for compression ratios in future work on optical character compression, OCR, and related fields.

Richer reasoning, however, often comes at the cost of longer chain of thought (CoT), hampering interaction efficiency in real-world scenarios. Nevertheless, there still lacks systematic definition of LLM agent efficiency, hindering targeted improvements. To this end, we introduce dual-efficiency, comprising (i) step-level efficiency, which minimizes tokens per step, and (ii) trajectory-level efficiency, which minimizes the number of steps to complete a task. Building on this definition, we propose DEPO, a dual-efficiency preference optimization method that jointly rewards succinct responses and fewer action steps. Experiments on WebShop and BabyAI show that DEPO cuts token usage by up to 60.9% and steps by up to 26.9%, while achieving up to a 29.3% improvement in performance. DEPO also generalizes to three out-of-domain math benchmarks and retains its efficiency gains when trained on only 25% of the data.

However, their direct application is fundamentally limited by a lack of stateful memory for iterative refinement and the difficulty of managing cluster granularity. As a result, existing methods often rely on complex pipelines with external modules, sacrificing a truly end-to-end approach. We introduce LLM-MemCluster, a novel framework that reconceptualizes clustering as a fully LLM-native task.

With the resultant growth of attention on language processing, significant challenges have emerged, including the lack of standardisation in organising and sharing linguistic data and the absence of standardised and reproducible processing methodologies. Striving for future standardisation, we first propose the Language Processing Data Structure (LPDS), a data structure inspired by the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a widely adopted standard for handling neuroscience data. It provides a folder structure and file naming conventions for linguistic research. Second, we introduce pelican nlp, a modular and extensible Python package designed to enable streamlined language processing, from initial data cleaning and task-specific preprocessing to the extraction of sophisticated linguistic and acoustic features, such as semantic embeddings and prosodic metrics. The entire processing workflow can be specified within a single, shareable configuration file, which pelican nlp then executes on LPDS-formatted data. Depending on the specifications, the reproducible output can consist of preprocessed language data or standardised extraction of both linguistic and acoustic features and corresponding result aggregations.

However, it is ethically and practically infeasible to conduct experiments that require controlling human learners' language inputs. This poses challenges for the verifiability and scalability of language acquisition modeling, particularly in Chinese second language acquisition (SLA). While LLMs provide a controllable and reproducible alternative, a systematic benchmark to support phase-wise modeling and assessment is still lacking. In this paper, we present HSKBenchmark, the first benchmark for staged modeling and writing assessment of LLMs in Chinese SLA. It covers HSK levels 3 to 6 and includes authentic textbooks with 6.76 million tokens, 16K synthetic instruction samples, 30 test topics, and a linguistically grounded evaluation system. To simulate human learning trajectories, we introduce a curriculum-tuning framework that trains models from beginner to advanced levels. An evaluation system is created to examine level-based grammar coverage, writing errors, lexical and syntactic complexity, and holistic scoring. We also build HSKAgent, fine-tuned on 10K learner compositions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that HSKBenchmark not only models Chinese SLA effectively, but also serves as a reliable benchmark for dynamic writing assessment in LLMs. Our fine-tuned LLMs have writing performance on par with advanced human learners and exhibit human-like acquisition characteristics. The HSKBenchmark, HSKAgent, and checkpoints serve as foundational tools and resources, with the potential to pave the way for future research on language acquisition modeling and LLMs interpretability.
