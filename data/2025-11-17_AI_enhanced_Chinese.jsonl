Multimodal recommendation systems, which leverage textual and visual data, offer a promising solution to mitigate these issues. However, existing industrial approaches typically adopt a two-stage training paradigm: first pretraining a multimodal model, then applying its frozen representations to train the recommendation model. This decoupled framework suffers from misalignment between multimodal learning and recommendation objectives, as well as an inability to adapt dynamically to new data. To address these limitations, we propose LEMUR, the first large-scale multimodal recommender system trained end-to-end from raw data. By jointly optimizing both the multimodal and recommendation components, LEMUR ensures tighter alignment with downstream objectives while enabling real-time parameter updates. Constructing multimodal sequential representations from user history often entails prohibitively high computational costs. To alleviate this bottleneck, we propose a novel memory bank mechanism that incrementally accumulates historical multimodal representations throughout the training process. After one month of deployment in Douyin Search, LEMUR has led to a 0.843% reduction in query change rate decay and a 0.81% improvement in QAUC. Additionally, LEMUR has shown significant gains across key offline metrics for Douyin Advertisement. Our results validate the superiority of end-to-end multimodal recommendation in real-world industrial scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "LEMUR\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u63a8\u8350\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6296\u97f3\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u5e7f\u544a\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6548\u679c\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8eID\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4e1a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08\u5148\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u518d\u51bb\u7ed3\u8868\u793a\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u65e0\u6cd5\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLEMUR\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u5f0f\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u63a8\u8350\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1b\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5e8f\u5217\u8868\u793a\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e93\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u589e\u91cf\u7d2f\u79ef\u5386\u53f2\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6296\u97f3\u641c\u7d22\u90e8\u7f72\u4e00\u4e2a\u6708\u540e\uff0cLEMUR\u4f7f\u67e5\u8be2\u53d8\u5316\u7387\u8870\u51cf\u51cf\u5c110.843%\uff0cQAUC\u63d0\u53470.81%\uff1b\u5728\u6296\u97f3\u5e7f\u544a\u4e2d\uff0c\u5404\u9879\u79bb\u7ebf\u6307\u6807\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u8350\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0cLEMUR\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

The End of Term Web Archive alone contains, among other file types, millions of PDFs produced by the federal government. While preservation with web archives has been successful, significant challenges for access and discoverability remain. For example, current affordances for browsing the End of Term PDFs are limited to downloading and browsing individual PDFs, as well as performing basic keyword search across them. In this paper, we introduce GovScape, a public search system that supports multimodal searches across 10,015,993 federal government PDFs from the 2020 End of Term crawl (70,958,487 total PDF pages) - to our knowledge, all renderable PDFs in the 2020 crawl that are 50 pages or under. GovScape supports four primary forms of search over these 10 million PDFs: in addition to providing (1) filter conditions over metadata facets including domain and crawl date and (2) exact text search against the PDF text, we provide (3) semantic text search and (4) visual search against the PDFs across individual pages, enabling users to structure queries such as \"redacted documents\" or \"pie charts.\" We detail the constituent components of GovScape, including the search affordances, embedding pipeline, system architecture, and open source codebase. Significantly, the total estimated compute cost for GovScape's pre-processing pipeline for 10 million PDFs was approximately $1,500, equivalent to 47,000 PDF pages per dollar spent on compute, demonstrating the potential for immediate scalability. Accordingly, we outline steps that we have already begun pursuing toward multimodal search at the 100+ million PDF scale.

In this paper, we propose a group recommender system called Group Soft-Impute SVD, which leverages soft-impute singular value decomposition to enhance group recommendations. This approach addresses the challenge of sparse high-dimensional data using low-rank matrix completion. We compared the performance of Group Soft-Impute SVD with Group MF based approaches and found that our method outperforms the baselines in recall for small user groups while achieving comparable results across all group sizes when tasked on Goodbooks, Movielens, and Synthetic datasets.

MOON has already been fully deployed across all stages of Taobao search advertising system, including retrieval, relevance, ranking, and so on. The performance gains are particularly significant on click-through rate (CTR) prediction task, which achieves an overall +20.00% online CTR improvement. Over the past three years, this project has delivered the largest improvement on CTR prediction task and undergone five full-scale iterations. Throughout the exploration and iteration of our MOON, we have accumulated valuable insights and practical experience that we believe will benefit the research community. MOON contains a three-stage training paradigm of \"Pretraining, Post-training, and Application\", allowing effective integration of multimodal representations with downstream tasks. Notably, to bridge the misalignment between the objectives of multimodal representation learning and downstream training, we define the exchange rate to quantify how effectively improvements in an intermediate metric can translate into downstream gains. Through this analysis, we identify the image-based search recall as a critical intermediate metric guiding the optimization of multimodal models. Over three years and five iterations, MOON has evolved along four critical dimensions: data processing, training strategy, model architecture, and downstream application. The lessons and insights gained through the iterative improvements will also be shared. As part of our exploration into scaling effects in the e-commerce field, we further conduct a systematic study of the scaling laws governing multimodal representation learning, examining multiple factors such as the number of training tokens, negative samples, and the length of user behavior sequences.", "AI": {"tldr": "MOON\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u8fed\u4ee3\u5b9e\u8df5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5df2\u5728\u6dd8\u5b9d\u641c\u7d22\u5e7f\u544a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5168\u9762\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u5728CTR\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8620.00%\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u70b9\u51fb\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5f25\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4ea4\u6362\u7387\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u4e2d\u95f4\u6307\u6807\u6539\u8fdb\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u6536\u76ca\u7684\u8f6c\u5316\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u53ec\u56de\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u4e2d\u95f4\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728CTR\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6574\u4f5320.00%\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u70b9\u51fb\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e09\u5e74\u4e2dCTR\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6700\u5927\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u7ecf\u5386\u4e86\u4e94\u6b21\u5168\u9762\u8fed\u4ee3\u3002", "conclusion": "MOON\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e94\u7528\u56db\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4e0d\u65ad\u6f14\u8fdb\uff0c\u79ef\u7d2f\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5bf9\u7814\u7a76\u793e\u533a\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u9886\u57df\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002"}}

Our framework operationalizes a closed-loop \"assess-validate-reflect\" cycle that harnesses the powerful in-context learning capabilities of LLMs. SRLF departs from conventional point-wise assessment by formulating a holistic judgment on an entire set of items. It accomplishes this by comprehensively analyzing both the intricate interrelationships among items within the set and their collective alignment with the user's preference profile. This method of set-level contextual understanding allows our model to capture complex relational patterns essential to user behavior, making it significantly more adept for sequential recommendation.

We present an architecture that resolves this tension through offline data augmentation and efficient parallel retrieval from structured episodic memory. Our system transforms biographical data into 1,774 enriched first-person memories with affective-semantic metadata, then employs two-stage retrieval achieving 0.52s prompt generation. Evaluation using LLM-as-judge and RAGAs metrics shows our approach achieves parity with traditional RAG on GPT-4 while significantly outperforming it on smaller models (GPT-3.5, GPT-3), suggesting particular value for resource-constrained deployments. Beyond dialogue, the structured memory enables novel visualization tools: spatiotemporal heatmaps, emotional trajectory analysis, and interactive path tracking, positioning the system as both a dialogue interface and research tool for biographical analysis. We use Van Gogh as a test case, but the architecture is generalizable to any historical figure with substantial textual records, offering a practical framework for educational, museum, and research applications requiring both accuracy and efficiency", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u5386\u53f2\u4eba\u7269\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u5386\u53f2\u4eba\u7269\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u5173\u952e\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u4ea7\u751f\u6d45\u5c42\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u800c\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u53cd\u601d\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f46\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8fc7\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u5c06\u4f20\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a1,774\u4e2a\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u5e26\u6709\u60c5\u611f\u8bed\u4e49\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u68c0\u7d22\u5b9e\u73b00.52\u79d2\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528LLM-as-judge\u548cRAGAs\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728GPT-4\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfRAG\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8f83\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\uff08GPT-3.5\u3001GPT-3\uff09\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfRAG\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u8bdd\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u8fd8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f20\u8bb0\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u65f6\u7a7a\u70ed\u56fe\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u8def\u5f84\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7b49\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u4efb\u4f55\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u6587\u672c\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u4eba\u7269\uff0c\u4e3a\u6559\u80b2\u3001\u535a\u7269\u9986\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

We present a novel approach to extracting structured data from multi-page government fiscal documents using LLM-based techniques. Applied to annual fiscal documents from the State of Karnataka in India (200+ pages), our method achieves high accuracy through a multi-stage pipeline that leverages domain knowledge, sequential context, and algorithmic validation. A large challenge with traditional OCR methods is the inability to verify the accurate extraction of numbers. When applied to fiscal data, the inherent structure of fiscal tables, with totals at each level of the hierarchy, allows for robust internal validation of the extracted data. We use these hierarchical relationships to create multi-level validation checks. We demonstrate that LLMs can read tables and also process document-specific structural hierarchies, offering a scalable process for converting PDF-based fiscal disclosures into research-ready databases.

However, the selection of in-context demonstrations plays a crucial role and can significantly affect LLMs' performance. Most existing demonstration selection methods primarily focus on semantic similarity between test inputs and demonstrations, often overlooking the importance of label distribution alignment. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage demonstration selection method, TopK + Label Distribution Divergence (L2D), which leverages a fine-tuned BERT-like small language model (SLM) to generate label distributions and calculate their divergence for both test inputs and candidate demonstrations.

This assumption is untested. We characterize temporal constraint processing across eight production-scale models (2.8-8B parameters) using deadline detection tasks, revealing systematic deployment risks: bimodal performance distribution (models achieve either 95% or 50% accuracy), extreme prompt brittleness (30-60 percentage point swings from formatting changes alone), and systematic action bias (100% false positive rates in failing models). Parameter count shows no correlation with capability in this range-a 3.8B model matches 7B models while other 7B models fail completely. Fine-tuning on 200 synthetic examples improves models with partial capability by 12-37 percentage points. We demonstrate that temporal constraint satisfaction cannot be reliably learned through next-token prediction on natural language, even with targeted fine-tuning. This capability requires architectural mechanisms for: (1) continuous temporal state representation, (2) explicit constraint checking separate from linguistic pattern matching, (3) systematic compositional reasoning over temporal relations. Current autoregressive architectures lack these mechanisms.

These modifications enhance graph fidelity while preserving the core spectral reasoning pipeline. Experimental results on ProofWriter, EntailmentBank, and CLUTRR benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains (up to +3.8\\%), improved generalization to adversarial cases, and reduced inference noise. The novelty lies in performing semantic and symbolic refinement entirely upstream of the spectral inference stage, enabling efficient, interpretable, and scalable reasoning without relying on quadratic attention mechanisms. In summary, this work extends the Spectral NSR framework with modular, semantically grounded preprocessing steps that improve graph quality without altering the core spectral reasoning engine.

Existing multi-objective alignment methods rely on manually specified preference weights, which not only burden users with difficult preference specification tasks but also lead to suboptimal training efficiency due to exploration of irrelevant preference combinations. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel framework named PRO, i.e., PReference Orchestrator, which features a lightweight preference adapter that automatically infers prompt-specific preference weights during both training and deployment phases. Specifically, the adapter automatically learns appropriate preference weights for each prompt by training on normalized reward scores from multiple reward models for preferred responses, which inherently reflect effective preference balances across objectives. Additionally, We provide theoretical analysis proving that our prompt-aware preference mechanism achieves superior performance compared to fixed preference weights in multi-objective alignment scenarios. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over existing multi-objective alignment approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "PRO\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u504f\u597d\u9002\u914d\u5668\u81ea\u52a8\u63a8\u65ad\u63d0\u793a\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u504f\u597d\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u624b\u52a8\u6307\u5b9a\u504f\u597d\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u52a8\u6307\u5b9a\u504f\u597d\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u589e\u52a0\u7528\u6237\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u8fd8\u56e0\u63a2\u7d22\u65e0\u5173\u504f\u597d\u7ec4\u5408\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u504f\u597d\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u591a\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9996\u9009\u54cd\u5e94\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u9002\u5f53\u504f\u597d\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u504f\u597d\u6743\u91cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "PRO\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u597d\u6743\u91cd\u81ea\u52a8\u63a8\u65ad\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We first identify a patent-specific failure mode of SimCSE style dropout augmentation: it produces overly uniform embeddings that lose semantic cohesion. To remedy this, we propose section-based augmentation, where different sections of a patent (e.g., abstract, claims, background) serve as complementary views. This design introduces natural semantic and structural diversity, mitigating over-dispersion and yielding embeddings that better preserve both global structure and local continuity. On large-scale benchmarks, our fully self-supervised method matches or surpasses citation-and IPC-supervised baselines in prior-art retrieval and classification, while avoiding reliance on brittle or incomplete annotations. Our analysis further shows that different sections specialize for different tasks-claims and summaries benefit retrieval, while background sections aid classification-highlighting the value of patents' inherent discourse structure for representation learning. These results highlight the value of exploiting intra-document views for scalable and generalizable patent understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e13\u5229\u6587\u6863\u5185\u90e8\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u4e13\u5229\u4e0d\u540c\u7ae0\u8282\uff08\u6458\u8981\u3001\u6743\u5229\u8981\u6c42\u3001\u80cc\u666f\u7b49\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e92\u8865\u89c6\u56fe\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86SimCSE\u98ce\u683cdropout\u589e\u5f3a\u5728\u4e13\u5229\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u4e49\u51dd\u805a\u6027\u4e27\u5931\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d1\u73b0SimCSE\u98ce\u683c\u7684dropout\u589e\u5f3a\u5728\u4e13\u5229\u5d4c\u5165\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5747\u5300\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u4e49\u51dd\u805a\u6027\u4e27\u5931\u3002\u4e13\u5229\u6587\u6863\u5929\u7136\u5177\u6709\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7ae0\u8282\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ae0\u8282\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u4e13\u5229\u6587\u6863\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u90e8\u5206\uff08\u5982\u6458\u8981\u3001\u6743\u5229\u8981\u6c42\u3001\u80cc\u666f\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u56fe\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5148\u6709\u6280\u672f\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f15\u7528\u548cIPC\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f9d\u8d56\u8106\u5f31\u6216\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e13\u5229\u6587\u6863\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u8bed\u7bc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7ae0\u8282\u4e13\u95e8\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u6743\u5229\u8981\u6c42\u548c\u6458\u8981\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u80cc\u666f\u90e8\u5206\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6587\u6863\u5185\u90e8\u89c6\u56fe\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u4e13\u5229\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

We evaluated 15 open-weight LLMs on pathology and radiology reports across six use cases, colorectal liver metastases, liver tumours, neurodegenerative diseases, soft-tissue tumours, melanomas, and sarcomas, at three institutes in the Netherlands, UK, and Czech Republic. Models included general-purpose and medical-specialised LLMs of various sizes, and six prompting strategies were compared: zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, self-consistency, and prompt graph. Performance was assessed using task-appropriate metrics, with consensus rank aggregation and linear mixed-effects models quantifying variance. Top-ranked models achieved macro-average scores close to inter-rater agreement across tasks. Small-to-medium general-purpose models performed comparably to large models, while tiny and specialised models performed worse. Prompt graph and few-shot prompting improved performance by ~13%. Task-specific factors, including variable complexity and annotation variability, influenced results more than model size or prompting strategy.

Accepted by EMNLP 2025. Code and additional details are available at: https://qihang-zhang.com/Learning-Sys-Blog/2025/10/15/weighted-product-of-experts.html", "summary": "Lossless compression techniques are crucial in an era of rapidly growing data. Traditional universal compressors like gzip offer low computational overhead, high speed, and broad applicability across data distributions. However, they often lead to worse compression rates than modern neural compressors, which leverage large-scale training data to model data distributions more effectively. Despite their advantages, neural compressors struggle to generalize to unseen data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that performs Test-Time Steering via a Weighted Product of Experts (wPoE). At inference, our method adaptively combines a universal compression model with a pretrained neural language model, ensuring the compression rate is at least as good as that of the best individual model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of text compression without requiring fine-tuning.

Such evaluations often rely on a curated benchmark set of input prompts provided to the LLM, where the output for each prompt may be assessed in a binary fashion (e.g., harmful/non-harmful or does not leak/leaks sensitive information), and the aggregation of binary scores is used to evaluate the LLM. However, existing approaches to evaluation often neglect statistical uncertainty quantification. With an applied statistics audience in mind, we provide background on LLM text generation and evaluation, and then describe a Bayesian approach for quantifying uncertainty in binary evaluation metrics. We focus in particular on uncertainty that is induced by the probabilistic text generation strategies typically deployed in LLM-based systems. We present two case studies applying this approach: 1) evaluating refusal rates on a benchmark of adversarial inputs designed to elicit harmful responses, and 2) evaluating pairwise preferences of one LLM over another on a benchmark of open-ended interactive dialogue examples. We demonstrate how the Bayesian approach can provide useful uncertainty quantification about the behavior of LLM-based systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e8c\u5143\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e2d\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u7531\u6982\u7387\u6027\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u5ffd\u89c6\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u4e8c\u5143\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u6709\u5bb3/\u65e0\u5bb3\uff09\u7684\u805a\u5408\u901a\u5e38\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u4e8c\u5143\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u7531\u6982\u7387\u6027\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u7387\uff1b2\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f00\u653e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u793a\u4f8b\u4e2d\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u504f\u597d\u3002", "result": "\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u7528\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u62d2\u7edd\u7387\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u597d\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u91cf\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u6982\u7387\u6027\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002"}}

We combine \\textbf{human evaluations} (rating fluency, factual accuracy, and cultural appropriateness) with automated metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) to assess model performance.\n  Our results reveal that while the largest proprietary models (GPT-4o, GPT-4, Claude~3.5) generally lead across languages and tasks, significant gaps persist in culturally nuanced understanding and morphological generalization. Notably, GPT-4o demonstrates robust multilingual performance even on cross-lingual tasks, and Claude~3.5~Sonnet achieves competitive accuracy on knowledge and reasoning benchmarks. However, all models struggle to some extent with the unique linguistic challenges of each language, such as Turkish agglutinative morphology and Cantonese colloquialisms. Smaller open-source models (LLaMA-2~13B, Mistral~7B) lag substantially in fluency and accuracy, highlighting the resource disparity.

We show that even meaning-preserving paraphrases can cause large fluctuations in safety scores, revealing a lack of semantic grounding. To address this, we introduce a practical, self-supervised framework for improving the semantic robustness of guard models. Our method leverages paraphrase sets to enforce prediction consistency using a novel, skew-aware aggregation strategy for robust target computation. Notably, we find that standard aggregation methods like mean and median can degrade safety, underscoring the need for skew-aware alternatives. We analyze six open-source guard models and show that our approach reduces semantic variability across paraphrases by ~58%, improves benchmark accuracy by ~2.5% on average, and generalizes to unseen stylistic variations. Intriguingly, we discover a bidirectional relationship between model calibration and consistency: our robustness training improves calibration by up to 40%, revealing a fundamental connection between these properties. These results highlight the value of treating semantic consistency as a first-class training objective and provide a scalable recipe for building more reliable guard models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u91ca\u4e49\u96c6\u5408\u548c\u504f\u659c\u611f\u77e5\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u9632\u62a4\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u7ea658%\uff0c\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u6a21\u578b\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u9632\u62a4\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8868\u9762\u8bed\u8a00\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u662fLLM\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u610f\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u91ca\u4e49\u4e5f\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u5927\u5e45\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bed\u4e49\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u91ca\u4e49\u96c6\u5408\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u504f\u659c\u611f\u77e5\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7a33\u5065\u76ee\u6807\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u516d\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u9632\u62a4\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u8de8\u91ca\u4e49\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea658%\uff0c\u57fa\u51c6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ea62.5%\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u6821\u51c6\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u53cc\u5411\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u5c06\u6821\u51c6\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fbe40%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9996\u8981\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9632\u62a4\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

True LLM understanding, analogous to human expertise, requires making consistent, well-founded decisions across multiple instances and diverse domains, relying on relevant and domain-grounded decision factors. We introduce Structured Tabular Decision Simulations (STaDS), a suite of expert-like decision settings that evaluate LLMs as if they were professionals undertaking structured decision ``exams''. In this context, understanding is defined as the ability to identify and rely on the correct decision factors, features that determine outcomes within a domain. STaDS jointly assesses understanding through: (i) question and instruction comprehension, (ii) knowledge-based prediction, and (iii) reliance on relevant decision factors. By analyzing 9 frontier LLMs across 15 diverse decision settings, we find that (a) most models struggle to achieve consistently strong accuracy across diverse domains; (b) models can be accurate yet globally unfaithful, and there are frequent mismatches between stated rationales and factors driving predictions.

Previous studies tend to rely on the model itself to implicitly learn semantic modeling during training, and resort to inefficient and costly manual annotations for these two challenges. To mitigate these limitations, we propose enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) speech projector, where each expert specializes in the semantic subspace of a specific language, enabling fine-grained modeling of speech features. Additionally, we introduce a multi-stage training paradigm that utilizes readily available monolingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) and monolingual ST data, facilitating speech-text alignment and improving translation capabilities. During training, we leverage a combination of language-specific loss and intra-group load balancing loss to guide the MoE speech projector in efficiently allocating tokens to the appropriate experts, across expert groups and within each group, respectively. To bridge the data gap across different training stages and improve adaptation to the CS scenario, we further employ a transition loss, enabling smooth transitions of data between stages, to effectively address the scarcity of high-quality CS speech translation data.

Existing fine-tuning methods offer limited improvement, failing to deeply intervene in factual reasoning. This paper introduces Grounded Visual Factualization (GVF) Finetuning, a novel approach to systematically enhance MLLM visual factual consistency. GVF integrates explicit factual signals via three core mechanisms: Factual Anchor Data Augmentation, enriching training data with structured factual anchors and counter-factual prompts; Fact-Aware Instruction Tuning, embedding these cues into explicit instructions; and a Factual Consistency Loss function, specifically penalizing factual inaccuracies. Evaluated on LLaVA-1.5-13B, GVF Finetuning significantly outperforms standard fine-tuning on the VHTest benchmark for both Open-Ended Question (OEQ) and Yes/No Question (YNQ) formats.

We introduce a framework for continual learning from human feedback in text-to-SQL, where a learning agent receives natural language feedback to refine queries and distills the revealed knowledge for reuse on future tasks. This distilled knowledge is stored in a structured memory, enabling the agent to improve execution accuracy over time.

As MoE models only activate part of the experts, related work has proposed expert prediction and caching methods to prefetch the experts for faster inference. However, existing approaches utilize the activations from the previous layer for prediction, incurring low accuracy and leave the first layer unoptimized. Applying complex layers or even training standalone networks for better prediction introduces high computation overhead. In this paper, we propose pre-attention expert prediction to achieve accurate and lightweight expert prefetching. The key insight is that some functions in LLMs are ranking-preserving, indicating that matching the ranking of selected experts using simple linear functions is possible. Therefore, we utilize the activations before the attention block in the same layer with 2 linear functions and ranking-aware loss to achieve accurate prediction, which also supports prefetching in the first layer.

These emissions are largely contributed to by the production, use and disposal of consumer products. Thus, it is important to build tools to estimate the environmental impact of consumer goods, an essential part of which is conducting Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs). LCAs specify and account for the appropriate processes involved with the production, use, and disposal of the products. We present SpiderGen, an LLM-based workflow which integrates the taxonomy and methodology of traditional LCA with the reasoning capabilities and world knowledge of LLMs to generate the procedural information used for LCA. We additionally evaluate the output of SpiderGen using real-world LCA documents as ground-truth. We find that SpiderGen provides accurate LCA process information that is either fully correct or has minor errors, achieving an F1-Score of 62% across 10 sample data points. We observe that the remaining missed processes and hallucinated errors occur primarily due to differences in detail between LCA documents, as well as differences in the \"scope\" of which auxiliary processes must also be included. We also demonstrate that SpiderGen performs better than several baselines techniques, such as chain-of-thought prompting and one-shot prompting. Finally, we highlight SpiderGen's potential to reduce the human effort and costs for estimating carbon impact, as it is able to produce LCA process information for less than \\$1 USD in under 10 minutes as compared to the status quo LCA, which can cost over \\$25000 USD and take up to 21-person days.", "AI": {"tldr": "SpiderGen\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u7edf\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08LCA\uff09\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5b66\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u4e0eLLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210LCA\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u6e29\u5ba4\u6c14\u4f53\u6392\u653e\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u6d88\u8d39\u54c1\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u5904\u7f6e\u9020\u6210\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d88\u8d39\u54c1\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08LCA\uff09\u662f\u5173\u952e\u90e8\u5206\u3002", "method": "SpiderGen\u6574\u5408\u4f20\u7edfLCA\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5b66\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u4e0eLLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7528\u4e8eLCA\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u5b9eLCA\u6587\u6863\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "SpiderGen\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u6216\u4ec5\u6709\u8f7b\u5fae\u9519\u8bef\u7684LCA\u6d41\u7a0b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u572810\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523062%\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "SpiderGen\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4f30\u7b97\u78b3\u5f71\u54cd\u6240\u9700\u7684\u4eba\u529b\u548c\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u80fd\u572810\u5206\u949f\u5185\u4ee5\u4e0d\u52301\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u6210\u672c\u751f\u6210LCA\u6d41\u7a0b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edfLCA\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u8fc725000\u7f8e\u5143\u548c21\u4eba\u5929\u3002"}}

Consequently, research has focused on evaluating the robustness of LLMs, an essential quality for real-world tasks. In this paper, we employ simple multi-turn follow-up prompts to evaluate models' answer changes, model accuracy dynamics across turns with Markov chains, and examine whether linear probes can predict these changes. Our results show significant vulnerabilities in LLM robustness: a simple \"Think again\" prompt led to an approximate 10% accuracy drop for Gemini 1.5 Flash over nine turns, while combining this prompt with a semantically equivalent reworded question caused a 7.5% drop for Claude 3.5 Haiku. Additionally, we find that model accuracy across turns can be effectively modeled using Markov chains, enabling the prediction of accuracy probabilities over time. This allows for estimation of the model's stationary (long-run) accuracy, which we find to be on average approximately 8% lower than its first-turn accuracy for Gemini 1.5 Flash. Our results from a model's hidden states also reveal evidence that linear probes can help predict future answer changes. Together, these results establish stationary accuracy as a principled robustness metric for interactive settings and expose the fragility of models under repeated questioning.

We investigate gender bias dynamics across three generations of recursive text generation using three complementary evaluation frameworks: rule-based pattern matching, embedding-based semantic similarity, and downstream task performance. Experiments with three initial bias levels (0.1, 0.3, 0.6) and four mitigation strategies reveal equilibrium dynamics rather than monotonic amplification. The low initial bias amplifies toward the model's inherent bias level (+36%), whereas the high initial bias decays toward it (-26%). Among mitigation methods, contrastive augmentation, which introduces gender-swapped variants, achieves significant downstream bias reduction (98.8% for low initial bias and 91% on average) despite producing higher embedding-based bias scores.

In this paper, we use the systems' preference bias to study their hidden language: During the process of compressing the input images (typically containing multiple concepts) into texts and then reconstructing them into images, the systems' inherent preference bias introduces specific shifts in the outputs, disrupting the original input concept co-occurrence. We employ the multi-round \"telephone game\" to strategically leverage this bias. By observing the co-occurrence frequencies of concepts in telephone games, we quantitatively investigate the concept connection strength in the understanding of multimodal systems, i.e., \"hidden language.\" We also contribute Telescope, a dataset of 10,000+ concept pairs, as the database of our telephone game framework. Our telephone game is test-time scalable: By iteratively running telephone games, we can construct a global map of concept connections in multimodal systems' understanding. Here we can identify preference bias inherited from training, assess generalization capability advancement, and discover more stable pathways for fragile concept connections. Furthermore, we use Reasoning-LLMs to uncover unexpected concept relationships that transcend textual and visual similarities, inferring how multimodal systems understand and simulate the world.

Although they are indispensable to evaluate model performance on various tasks, it is uncertain whether the models trained on Internet data have genuinely learned how to solve problems or merely seen the questions before. This potential data contamination issue presents a fundamental challenge to establishing trustworthy evaluation frameworks. Meanwhile, existing benchmarks predominantly assume benign, resource-rich settings, leaving the behavior of LLMs under pressure unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Squid Game, a dynamic and adversarial evaluation environment with resource-constrained and asymmetric information settings elaborated to evaluate LLMs through interactive gameplay against other LLM opponents. Notably, Squid Game consists of six elimination-style levels, focusing on multi-faceted abilities, such as instruction-following, code, reasoning, planning, and safety alignment. We evaluate over 50 LLMs on Squid Game, presenting the largest behavioral evaluation study of general LLMs on dynamic adversarial scenarios.

This study investigates whether state-of-the-art text-to-speech systems have internalized the human tendency to reduce speech rate to convey politeness - a non-obvious prosodic marker. We prompted 22 synthetic voices from two leading AI platforms (AI Studio and OpenAI) to read a fixed script under both \"polite and formal\" and \"casual and informal\" conditions and measured the resulting speech duration. Across both AI platforms, the polite prompt produced slower speech than the casual prompt with very large effect sizes, an effect that was statistically significant for all of AI Studio's voices and for a large majority of OpenAI's voices.

Leveraging historical records from the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), we developed a bias evaluation framework comprising three distinct tests to explore nation-level bias in various LLMs, with a particular focus on the five permanent members of the UNSC. Experimental results show that, even with the general bias patterns across models (e.g., favorable biases toward the western nations, and unfavorable biases toward Russia), these still vary based on the LLM. Notably, even within the same LLM, the direction and magnitude of bias for a nation change depending on the evaluation context. This observation suggests that LLM biases are fundamentally multidimensional, varying across models and tasks. We also observe that models with stronger reasoning abilities show reduced bias and better performance. Building on this finding, we introduce a debiasing framework that improves LLMs' factual reasoning combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Reflexion-based self-reflection techniques. Experiments show it effectively reduces nation-level bias, and improves performance, particularly in GPT-4o-mini and LLama-3.3-70B.

While sparse attention mechanisms like RingAttention reduce computational costs by restricting attention to local neighborhoods, they suffer from limited receptive fields and lack of adaptability. We present \\PiAttention, a periodic sparse Transformer that factorizes attention into ring-local neighborhoods, deterministic $\u03c0$-stride skips, and an adaptive fusion gate. The periodic structure provides predictable coverage of distant tokens, while the sparse footprint keeps the per-layer complexity linear in context length. We prove that \\PiAttention achieves $\\mathcal{O}(kL + \u03c0\\log L)$ receptive field growth compared to $\\mathcal{O}(kL)$ for RingAttention, where $k$ is the local window size, $\u03c0$ is the skip period, and $L$ is the sequence length. Extensive experiments on language modeling, retrieval, and vision-language tasks demonstrate that \\PiAttention matches or surpasses dense attention quality with 8.3\\% lower perplexity than RingAttention while using 50\\% fewer GPUs for the same context length.

In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using an LLM (GPT-4o) to evaluate short-answer quizzes and project reports in an undergraduate Computational Linguistics course. We collect responses from approximately 50 students across five quizzes and receive project reports from 14 teams. LLM-generated scores are compared against human evaluations conducted independently by the course teaching assistants (TAs). Our results show that GPT-4o achieves strong correlation with human graders (up to 0.98) and exact score agreement in 55\\% of quiz cases.

Do they form shared multilingual representations with language-specific decoding, and if so, why does performance still favor the dominant training language? To address this, we train a series of LLMs on different mixtures of multilingual data and analyze their internal mechanisms using cross-layer transcoders (CLT) and attribution graphs. Our results provide strong evidence for pivot language representations: the model employs nearly identical representations across languages, while language-specific decoding emerges in later layers. Attribution analyses reveal that decoding relies in part on a small set of high-frequency language features in the final layers, which linearly read out language identity from the first layers in the model. By intervening on these features, we can suppress one language and substitute another in the model's outputs. Finally, we study how the dominant training language influences these mechanisms across attribution graphs and decoding pathways. We argue that understanding this pivot-language mechanism is crucial for improving multilingual alignment in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u7528\u67a2\u8f74\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u95f4\u4f7f\u7528\u51e0\u4e4e\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u800c\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u540e\u671f\u5c42\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5e72\u9884\u9ad8\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u4e00\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u5e76\u7528\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u5982\u4f55\u8868\u793a\u8fd9\u79cd\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7a76\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u5f62\u6210\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e3a\u4f55\u6027\u80fd\u4ecd\u504f\u5411\u4e3b\u5bfc\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u3002", "method": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u4e0a\u7684LLMs\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8de8\u5c42\u8f6c\u7801\u5668\uff08CLT\uff09\u548c\u5f52\u56e0\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5e72\u9884\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u7528\u67a2\u8f74\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\uff1a\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u51e0\u4e4e\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5b9a\u89e3\u7801\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u540e\u671f\u5c42\u3002\u5f52\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u89e3\u7801\u90e8\u5206\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6700\u7ec8\u5c42\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u7b2c\u4e00\u5c42\u7ebf\u6027\u8bfb\u53d6\u8bed\u8a00\u8eab\u4efd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7406\u89e3\u67a2\u8f74\u8bed\u8a00\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdbLLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4e3b\u5bfc\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u901a\u8fc7\u5f52\u56e0\u56fe\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u8def\u5f84\u5f71\u54cd\u8fd9\u4e9b\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

However, models often rely on annotations that reflect dominant cultural norms, limiting model ability to recognize emotional expression in dialects often excluded from training data distributions, such as African American Vernacular English (AAVE). This study examines emotion recognition model performance on AAVE compared to General American English (GAE). We analyze 2.7 million tweets geo-tagged within Los Angeles. Texts are scored for strength of AAVE using computational approximations of dialect features. Annotations of emotion presence and intensity are collected on a dataset of 875 tweets with both high and low AAVE densities. To assess model accuracy on a task as subjective as emotion perception, we calculate community-informed \"silver\" labels where AAVE-dense tweets are labeled by African American, AAVE-fluent (ingroup) annotators. On our labeled sample, GPT and BERT-based models exhibit false positive prediction rates of anger on AAVE more than double than on GAE. SpanEmo, a popular text-based emotion model, increases false positive rates of anger from 25 percent on GAE to 60 percent on AAVE. Additionally, a series of linear regressions reveals that models and non-ingroup annotations are significantly more correlated with profanity-based AAVE features than ingroup annotations. Linking Census tract demographics, we observe that neighborhoods with higher proportions of African American residents are associated with higher predictions of anger (Pearson's correlation r = 0.27) and lower joy (r = -0.10). These results find an emergent safety issue of emotion AI reinforcing racial stereotypes through biased emotion classification.

We address this limitation by first aligning the models' parameter spaces, leveraging the inherent permutation, rotation, and scaling symmetries of Transformer architectures. We adapt parameter space alignment for modern Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) and SwiGLU layers, exploring both weight-based and activation-based approaches.

Under review at IWSDS 2026", "summary": "LLMs are increasingly employed as judges across a variety of tasks, including those involving everyday social interactions. Yet, it remains unclear whether such LLM-judges can reliably assess tasks that require social or conversational judgment. We investigate how an LLM's conviction is changed when a task is reframed from a direct factual query to a Conversational Judgment Task. Our evaluation framework contrasts the model's performance on direct factual queries with its assessment of a speaker's correctness when the same information is presented within a minimal dialogue, effectively shifting the query from \"Is this statement correct?\" to \"Is this speaker correct?\". Furthermore, we apply pressure in the form of a simple rebuttal (\"The previous answer is incorrect.\") to both conditions. This perturbation allows us to measure how firmly the model maintains its position under conversational pressure. Our findings show that while some models like GPT-4o-mini reveal sycophantic tendencies under social framing tasks, others like Llama-8B-Instruct become overly-critical. We observe an average performance change of 9.24% across all models, demonstrating that even minimal dialogue context can significantly alter model judgment, underscoring conversational framing as a key factor in LLM-based evaluation. The proposed framework offers a reproducible methodology for diagnosing model conviction and contributes to the development of more trustworthy dialogue systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u5728\u793e\u4ea4\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u4f1a\u56e0\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6539\u53d8\u800c\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e5f\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u5224\u65ad\uff0cGPT-4o-mini\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8fce\u5408\u503e\u5411\uff0cLlama-8B-Instruct\u5219\u53d8\u5f97\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6279\u5224\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u5728\u9700\u8981\u793e\u4ea4\u6216\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u4efb\u52a1\u4ece\u76f4\u63a5\u4e8b\u5b9e\u67e5\u8be2\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5224\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\uff0cLLM\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u5982\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76f4\u63a5\u4e8b\u5b9e\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0e\u6700\u5c0f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u53cd\u9a73\u65bd\u52a0\u538b\u529b\u6765\u6d4b\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u7acb\u573a\u7684\u575a\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u793e\u4ea4\u6846\u67b6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u53d8\u5316\u8fbe9.24%\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6846\u67b6\u662fLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8bca\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\u4fe1\u5ff5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Previous research has focused on detecting and addressing negative attention heads that induce negative bias. However, the underlying detailed factors influencing negative bias remain underexplored. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs exhibit format-level negative bias, meaning the prompt format more influences their responses than the semantics of the negative response. For the fine-grained study of the negative bias, we introduce a pipeline for constructing the evaluation set, which systematically categorizes the dataset into three subsets based on the model's parametric knowledge: correct, incorrect, and insufficient relevant knowledge. Through analysis of this evaluation set, we identify a shortcut behavior in which models tend to generate negative responses when they lack sufficient knowledge to answer a yes-no question, leading to negative bias. We further examine how negative bias changes under various prompting scenarios related to parametric knowledge. We observe that providing relevant context and offering an \"I don't know\" option generally reduces negative bias, whereas chain-of-thought prompting tends to amplify the bias. Finally, we demonstrate that the degree of negative bias can vary depending on the type of prompt, which influences the direction of the response.

MedPath directly enables new research frontiers in biomedical NLP, facilitating training and evaluation of semantic-rich and interpretable EL systems, and the development of the next generation of interoperable and explainable clinical NLP models.", "AI": {"tldr": "MedPath\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u9886\u57df\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u5b9e\u4f53\u94fe\u63a5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e869\u4e2a\u73b0\u6709\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7UMLS\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u300162\u4e2a\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u6620\u5c04\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u672c\u4f53\u8def\u5f84\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66NER\u548cEL\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6570\u636e\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\u8d44\u6e90\u7f3a\u4e4f\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u76f2\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6307\u6807\u9650\u5236\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u94fe\u63a5\u9886\u57df\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bed\u4e49\u76f2\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6307\u6807\u7684\u9650\u5236\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e9\u4e2a\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u5b9e\u4f53\u94fe\u63a5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6784\u5efaMedPath\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u5b9e\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u65b0\u7248UMLS\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\uff1b2\uff09\u6620\u5c04\u523062\u4e2a\u5176\u4ed6\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\uff1b3\uff09\u5728\u6700\u591a11\u4e2a\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u4e2d\u589e\u5f3a\u5b8c\u6574\u672c\u4f53\u8def\u5f84\uff08\u4ece\u4e00\u822c\u5230\u5177\u4f53\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u4e86MedPath\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u80fd\u591f\u76f4\u63a5\u652f\u6301\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66NLP\u7684\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u94fe\u63a5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u53ef\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e34\u5e8aNLP\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u3002", "conclusion": "MedPath\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u73b0\u6709\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u5b9e\u4f53\u94fe\u63a5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5148\u8fdb\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u4e34\u5e8aNLP\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, it remains unclear whether these tool-enabled gains reflect trustworthy reasoning. Focusing on the Code Interpreter tool, we show that even when tools are selected and executed correctly, TaLMs treat tool outputs as substitutes for reasoning, producing solutions that appear correct but lack coherent justification. We term this failure mode Tool-Induced Myopia (TIM), and study it using PYMATH, a benchmark of 1,679 competition-level mathematical problems for which Python code is helpful but not sufficient. We further develop a multi-dimensional evaluation suite to quantify reasoning degradation in TaLMs relative to their non-tool counterparts. Our findings reveal that while TaLMs achieve up to a 19.3 percentage point gain in final-answer accuracy, their reasoning behavior consistently deteriorates (e.g., non-tool LLMs win up to 41.5% more often in pairwise comparisons of the reasoning process). This degradation intensifies with tool use; the more frequently a model invokes tools, the less coherent its reasoning becomes. Moreover, tool use shifts errors from arithmetic mistakes toward global reasoning failures (logic, assumption, creativity); with TIM present in ~55% of high-risk cases. Finally, we propose a preference-optimization-based framework that realigns TaLMs to use tools as assistive evidence, improving both final-answer accuracy and reasoning depth under tool use.

We address this gap with EMSQA, an 24.3K-question multiple-choice dataset spanning 10 clinical subject areas and 4 certification levels, accompanied by curated, subject area-aligned knowledge bases (40K documents and 2M tokens). Building on EMSQA, we introduce (i) Expert-CoT, a prompting strategy that conditions chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning on specific clinical subject area and certification level, and (ii) ExpertRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline that grounds responses in subject area-aligned documents and real-world patient data. Experiments on 4 LLMs show that Expert-CoT improves up to 2.05% over vanilla CoT prompting.

A small dataset of 600 sentences labeled with six cognitive categories - Knowledge, Comprehension, Application, Analysis, Synthesis, and Evaluation - was processed using traditional machine learning (ML) models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines), recurrent neural network architectures (LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, BiGRU), transformer-based models (BERT and RoBERTa), and large language models (OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, Anthropic). Each model was evaluated under different preprocessing and augmentation strategies (for example, synonym replacement, word embeddings, etc.). Among traditional ML approaches, Support Vector Machines (SVM) with data augmentation achieved the best overall performance, reaching 94 percent accuracy, recall, and F1 scores with minimal overfitting. In contrast, the RNN models and BERT suffered from severe overfitting, while RoBERTa initially overcame it but began to show signs as training progressed. Finally, zero-shot evaluations of large language models (LLMs) indicated that OpenAI and Gemini performed best among the tested LLMs, achieving approximately 0.72-0.73 accuracy and comparable F1 scores. These findings highlight the challenges of training complex deep models on limited data and underscore the value of careful data augmentation and simpler algorithms (such as augmented SVM) for Bloom's Taxonomy classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u7c7b\u8003\u8bd5\u9898\u76ee\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u679c\u5230\u5e03\u9c81\u59c6\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u7684\u516d\u4e2a\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c42\u7ea7\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\uff08SVM\uff09\u914d\u5408\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0894%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002", "motivation": "\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u5c06\u8003\u8bd5\u9898\u76ee\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u679c\u5206\u7c7b\u5230\u5e03\u9c81\u59c6\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u7684\u516d\u4e2a\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c42\u7ea7\uff08\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u5e94\u7528\u3001\u5206\u6790\u3001\u7efc\u5408\u3001\u8bc4\u4ef7\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u6559\u80b2\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528600\u4e2a\u6807\u6ce8\u53e5\u5b50\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u6734\u7d20\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u3001\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u3001SVM\uff09\u3001\u5faa\u73af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08LSTM\u3001BiLSTM\u3001GRU\u3001BiGRU\uff09\u3001\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff08BERT\u3001RoBERTa\uff09\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08OpenAI\u3001Gemini\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u548c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "SVM\u914d\u5408\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\uff0894%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\uff09\uff0c\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u6700\u5c0f\u3002RNN\u548cBERT\u6a21\u578b\u4e25\u91cd\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0cRoBERTa\u521d\u671f\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u4f46\u540e\u671f\u51fa\u73b0\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u8ff9\u8c61\u3002\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cOpenAI\u548cGemini\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff08\u7ea60.72-0.73\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u800c\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u914d\u5408\u4ed4\u7ec6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff08\u5982\u589e\u5f3aSVM\uff09\u5728\u5e03\u9c81\u59c6\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

While these translations demand discourse-level coherence and strict terminological precision, current evaluation methods predominantly focus on segment-level accuracy and fluency. To address this limitation, we introduce DiscoX, a new benchmark for discourse-level and expert-level Chinese-English translation. It comprises 200 professionally-curated texts from 7 domains, with an average length exceeding 1700 tokens. To evaluate performance on DiscoX, we also develop Metric-S, a reference-free system that provides fine-grained automatic assessments across accuracy, fluency, and appropriateness. Metric-S demonstrates strong consistency with human judgments, significantly outperforming existing metrics. Our experiments reveal a remarkable performance gap: even the most advanced LLMs still trail human experts on these tasks. This finding validates the difficulty of DiscoX and underscores the challenges that remain in achieving professional-grade machine translation.

Among these, direct preference optimization (DPO) has emerged as a widely adopted technique that fine-tunes LLMs on preferred completions over less favorable ones. While most frontier LLMs do not disclose their curated preference pairs, the broader LLM community has released several open-source DPO datasets, including TuluDPO, ORPO, UltraFeedback, HelpSteer, and Code-Preference-Pairs. However, systematic comparisons remain scarce, largely due to the high computational cost and the lack of rich quality annotations, making it difficult to understand how preferences were selected, which task types they span, and how well they reflect human judgment on a per-sample level. In this work, we present the first comprehensive, data-centric analysis of popular open-source DPO corpora. We leverage the Magpie framework to annotate each sample for task category, input quality, and preference reward, a reward-model-based signal that validates the preference order without relying on human annotations. This enables a scalable, fine-grained inspection of preference quality across datasets, revealing structural and qualitative discrepancies in reward margins. Building on these insights, we systematically curate a new DPO mixture, UltraMix, that draws selectively from all five corpora while removing noisy or redundant samples. UltraMix is 30% smaller than the best-performing individual dataset yet exceeds its performance across key benchmarks. We publicly release all annotations, metadata, and our curated mixture to facilitate future research in data-centric preference optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u4e3b\u6d41\u5f00\u6e90DPO\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9996\u6b21\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5229\u7528Magpie\u6846\u67b6\u6807\u6ce8\u6837\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684UltraMix\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5f00\u6e90DPO\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u504f\u597d\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u5f0f\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u4ee5\u53ca\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u53cd\u6620\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Magpie\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u522b\u3001\u8f93\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u504f\u597d\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u504f\u597d\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8d28\u91cf\u68c0\u67e5\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u8fb9\u9645\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7684UltraMix\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73\u5355\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5c0f30%\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5173\u952e\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347DPO\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Through extensive experiments, we show that renormalization consistently and statistically significantly improves the performance of existing models on the Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB). In particular, across 38 models, renormalization improves performance by 9.7 $\u03c3$ on retrieval tasks, 3.1 $\u03c3$ on classification tasks, and 0.8 $\u03c3$ on other types of tasks. Renormalization has two variants: directly subtracting $\u03bc$ from $e$, or subtracting the projection of $e$ onto $\u03bc$.

Motivated by these developments, we present a framework for analysing personal attacks in U.S. presidential debates.

This has sparked growing interest in Meme Emotion Understanding (MEU), which aims to classify the emotional intent behind memes by leveraging their multimodal contents. While existing efforts have achieved promising results, two major challenges remain: (1) a lack of fine-grained multimodal fusion strategies, and (2) insufficient mining of memes' implicit meanings and background knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose MemoDetector, a novel framework for advancing MEU. First, we introduce a four-step textual enhancement module that utilizes the rich knowledge and reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to progressively infer and extract implicit and contextual insights from memes. These enhanced texts significantly enrich the original meme contents and provide valuable guidance for downstream classification. Next, we design a dual-stage modal fusion strategy: the first stage performs shallow fusion on raw meme image and text, while the second stage deeply integrates the enhanced visual and textual features. This hierarchical fusion enables the model to better capture nuanced cross-modal emotional cues. Experiments on two datasets, MET-MEME and MOOD, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Specifically, MemoDetector improves F1 scores by 4.3\\% on MET-MEME and 3.4\\% on MOOD. Further ablation studies and in-depth analyses validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, highlighting its strong potential for advancing MEU.

While it performs strongly on zero-shot and few-shot tasks, its robustness to linguistic variation, particularly paraphrasing, remains underexplored. Paraphrase robustness is essential for reliable deployment, especially in socially sensitive contexts where inconsistent representations can amplify demographic biases. In this paper, we introduce the Paraphrase Ranking Stability Metric (PRSM), a novel measure for quantifying CLIP's sensitivity to paraphrased queries. Using the Social Counterfactuals dataset, a benchmark designed to reveal social and demographic biases, we empirically assess CLIP's stability under paraphrastic variation, examine the interaction between paraphrase robustness and gender, and discuss implications for fairness and equitable deployment of multimodal systems. Our analysis reveals that robustness varies across paraphrasing strategies, with subtle yet consistent differences observed between male- and female-associated queries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PRSM\u6307\u6807\u6765\u91cf\u5316CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6539\u5199\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCLIP\u7684\u6539\u5199\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u7537\u6027\u548c\u5973\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u67e5\u8be2\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u7ec6\u5fae\u4f46\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u53d8\u4f53\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6539\u5199\uff09\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u6539\u5199\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5bf9\u4e8e\u53ef\u9760\u90e8\u7f72\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u654f\u611f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u53ef\u80fd\u653e\u5927\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86Paraphrase Ranking Stability Metric (PRSM)\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u6765\u91cf\u5316CLIP\u5bf9\u6539\u5199\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Social Counterfactuals\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30CLIP\u5728\u6539\u5199\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u968f\u6539\u5199\u7b56\u7565\u4e0d\u540c\u800c\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u7537\u6027\u548c\u5973\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u67e5\u8be2\u4e4b\u95f4\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7ec6\u5fae\u4f46\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6539\u5199\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

To further enhance reasoning and accuracy on complex tasks, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as a promising framework that engages multiple LLM agents in structured debates to encourage diverse reasoning. However, triggering MAD for every query is inefficient, as it incurs substantial computational (token) cost and may even degrade accuracy by overturning correct single-agent answers. To address these limitations, we propose intelligent Multi-Agent Debate (iMAD), a token-efficient framework that selectively triggers MAD only when it is likely to be beneficial (i.e., correcting an initially wrong answer). To achieve this goal, iMAD learns generalizable model behaviors to make accurate debate decisions. Specifically, iMAD first prompts a single agent to produce a structured self-critique response, from which we extract 41 interpretable linguistic and semantic features capturing hesitation cues. Then, iMAD uses a lightweight debate-decision classifier, trained using our proposed FocusCal loss, to determine whether to trigger MAD, enabling robust debate decisions without test dataset-specific tuning. Through extensive experiments using six (visual) question answering datasets against five competitive baselines, we have shown that iMAD significantly reduces token usage (by up to 92%) while also improving final answer accuracy (by up to 13.5%).", "AI": {"tldr": "iMAD\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u89e6\u53d1\u8fa9\u8bba\u6765\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff08\u6700\u591a92%\uff09\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff08\u6700\u591a13.5%\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u67e5\u8be2\u90fd\u8fdb\u884c\u8fa9\u8bba\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u63a8\u7ffb\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8fa9\u8bba\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "iMAD\u9996\u5148\u8ba9\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u81ea\u6211\u6279\u8bc4\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4ece\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d641\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u6355\u6349\u72b9\u8c6b\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8fa9\u8bba\u51b3\u7b56\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff08\u91c7\u7528FocusCal\u635f\u5931\u8bad\u7ec3\uff09\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u89e6\u53d1\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\uff08\u89c6\u89c9\uff09\u95ee\u7b54\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0ciMAD\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86token\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\uff08\u6700\u591a92%\uff09\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff08\u6700\u591a13.5%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "iMAD\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u89e6\u53d1\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this paper, we intend to analyze and experiment with the best of existing adversarial attack recipes and create new ones. We concentrated on developing a novel adversarial attack strategy on current state-of-the-art machine learning models by producing ambiguous inputs for the models to confound them and then constructing the path to the future development of the robustness of the models. We will develop adversarial instances with maximum perplexity, utilizing machine learning and deep learning approaches in order to trick the models. In our attack recipe, we will analyze several datasets and focus on creating obfuscous adversary examples to put the models in a state of perplexity, and by including the Bangla Language in the field of adversarial attacks.

Our system operates on egocentric binaural audio and uses the wearer's self-speech as an anchor, leveraging turn-taking behavior and dialogue dynamics to infer conversational partners and suppress others. To enable real-time, on-device operation, we propose a dual-model architecture: a lightweight streaming model runs every 12.5 ms for low-latency extraction of the conversation partners, while a slower model runs less frequently to capture longer-range conversational dynamics. Results on real-world 2- and 3-speaker conversation test sets, collected with binaural egocentric hardware from 11 participants totaling 6.8 hours, show generalization in identifying and isolating conversational partners in multi-conversation settings. Our work marks a step toward hearing assistants that adapt proactively to conversational dynamics and engagement.

Training-time alignment methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) face prohibitive costs in expert supervision and inherent scalability limitations, offering limited dynamic control during inference. Consequently, there is an urgent need for scalable and adaptable alignment mechanisms. To address this, we propose W2S-AlignTree, a pioneering plug-and-play inference-time alignment framework that synergistically combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with the Weak-to-Strong Generalization paradigm for the first time. W2S-AlignTree formulates LLM alignment as an optimal heuristic search problem within a generative search tree. By leveraging weak model's real-time, step-level signals as alignment proxies and introducing an Entropy-Aware exploration mechanism, W2S-AlignTree enables fine-grained guidance during strong model's generation without modifying its parameters. The approach dynamically balances exploration and exploitation in high-dimensional generation search trees. Experiments across controlled sentiment generation, summarization, and instruction-following show that W2S-AlignTree consistently outperforms strong baselines. Notably, W2S-AlignTree raises the performance of Llama3-8B from 1.89 to 2.19, a relative improvement of 15.9 on the summarization task.", "AI": {"tldr": "W2S-AlignTree\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u4e0e\u5f31\u5230\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u8303\u5f0f\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f31\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u9f50\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u5e38\u5e38\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982RLHF\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5c06LLM\u5bf9\u9f50\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u641c\u7d22\u6811\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f31\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6b65\u7ea7\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u9f50\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u71b5\u611f\u77e5\u63a2\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u751f\u6210\u3001\u6458\u8981\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cW2S-AlignTree\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c06Llama3-8B\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4ece1.89\u63d0\u5347\u52302.19\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u6539\u8fdb15.9%\u3002", "conclusion": "W2S-AlignTree\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To address this, we introduce Professional Reasoning Bench (PRBench), a realistic, open-ended, and difficult benchmark of real-world problems in Finance and Law. We open-source its 1,100 expert-authored tasks and 19,356 expert-curated criteria, making it, to our knowledge, the largest public, rubric-based benchmark for both legal and finance domains. We recruit 182 qualified professionals, holding JDs, CFAs, or 6+ years of experience, who contributed tasks inspired by their actual workflows. This process yields significant diversity, with tasks spanning 114 countries and 47 US jurisdictions. Our expert-curated rubrics are validated through a rigorous quality pipeline, including independent expert validation. Subsequent evaluation of 20 leading models reveals substantial room for improvement, with top scores of only 0.39 (Finance) and 0.37 (Legal) on our Hard subsets. We further catalog associated economic impacts of the prompts and analyze performance using human-annotated rubric categories. Our analysis shows that models with similar overall scores can diverge significantly on specific capabilities.
