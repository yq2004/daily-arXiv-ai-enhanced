However, existing expansion methods\nadopt uniform strategies that overlook user-specific semantics, ignoring\nindividual expression styles, preferences, and historical context. In practice,\nidentical queries in text can express vastly different intentions across users.\nThis representational rigidity limits the ability of current RAG systems to\ngeneralize effectively in personalized settings. Specifically, we identify two\ncore challenges for personalization: 1) user expression styles are inherently\ndiverse, making it difficult for standard expansions to preserve personalized\nintent. 2) user corpora induce heterogeneous semantic structures-varying in\ntopical focus and lexical organization-which hinders the effective anchoring of\nexpanded queries within the user's corpora space. To address these challenges,\nwe propose Personalize Before Retrieve (PBR), a framework that incorporates\nuser-specific signals into query expansion prior to retrieval. PBR consists of\ntwo components: P-PRF, which generates stylistically aligned pseudo feedback\nusing user history for simulating user expression style, and P-Anchor, which\nperforms graph-based structure alignment over user corpora to capture its\nstructure. Together, they produce personalized query representations tailored\nfor retrieval. Experiments on two personalized benchmarks show that PBR\nconsistently outperforms strong baselines, with up to 10% gains on PersonaBench\nacross retrievers.

In\nreality, human texts do not constitute a unified distribution, and their\ndiversity cannot be effectively captured through limited sampling. This causes\nprevious classifiers to memorize observed OOD characteristics rather than learn\nthe essence of `non-ID' behavior, limiting generalization to unseen\nhuman-authored inputs. Based on this observation, we propose reframing the\ndetection task as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem, treating\nhuman-written texts as distributional outliers while machine-generated texts\nare in-distribution (ID) samples. To this end, we develop a detection framework\nusing one-class learning method including DeepSVDD and HRN, and score-based\nlearning techniques such as energy-based method, enabling robust and\ngeneralizable performance. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets\nvalidate the effectiveness of our OOD-based approach. Specifically, the\nOOD-based method achieves 98.3% AUROC and AUPR with only 8.9% FPR95 on DeepFake\ndataset. Moreover, we test our detection framework on multilingual, attacked,\nand unseen-model and -domain text settings, demonstrating the robustness and\ngeneralizability of our framework. Code, pretrained weights, and demo will be\nreleased."}

Current context compression methods predominantly rely on\nautoencoding tasks to train context-agnostic compression tokens to compress\ncontextual semantics. While autoencoding tasks enable compression tokens to\nacquire compression capabilities, compression via autoencoding tasks creates a\nfundamental mismatch: the models are optimized for reconstruction that diverge\nfrom actual downstream tasks, thereby weakening the features more beneficial\nfor real-world usage. We propose Semantic-Anchor Compression (SAC), a novel\nmethod that shifts from autoencoding task based compression to an architecture\nthat is equipped with this compression capability \\textit{a priori}. Instead of\ntraining models to compress contexts through autoencoding tasks, SAC directly\nselects so-called anchor tokens from the original context and aggregates\ncontextual information into their key-value (KV) representations. By deriving\nrepresentations directly from the contextual tokens, SAC eliminates the need\nfor autoencoding training. To ensure compression performance while directly\nleveraging anchor tokens, SAC incorporates two key designs: (1) anchor\nembeddings that enable the compressor to identify critical tokens, and (2)\nbidirectional attention modification that allows anchor tokens to capture\ninformation from the entire context. Experimental results demonstrate that SAC\nconsistently outperforms existing context compression methods across various\ncompression ratios. On out-of-distribution evaluation using MRQA, SAC achieves\n1 EM improvement at 5x compression over strong baselines, with increasing\nadvantages at higher compression ratios."}

Experiments on\nthe mVCR test set demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, and ablation\nstudies confirm the complementary contributions of KG enrichment, hierarchical\nindexing, and targeted LLM re-ranking. The proposed method offers an accurate\nand scalable solution for multilingual retrieval in specialized medical video\ncollections."}

While recent work has examined\nfinal-answer accuracy in multilingual settings, the thinking traces themselves,\ni.e., the intermediate steps that lead to the final answer, remain\nunderexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of\nmultilingual CoT reasoning, evaluating three key dimensions: performance,\nconsistency, and faithfulness. We begin by measuring language compliance,\nanswer accuracy, and answer consistency when LRMs are explicitly instructed or\nprompt-hacked to think in a target language, revealing strong language\npreferences and divergent performance across languages. Next, we assess\ncrosslingual consistency of thinking traces by interchanging them between\nlanguages. We find that the quality and effectiveness of thinking traces vary\nsubstantially depending on the prompt language. Finally, we adapt\nperturbation-based techniques -- i.e., truncation and error injection -- to\nprobe the faithfulness of thinking traces across languages, showing that models\nrely on traces to varying degrees. We release our code and data to support\nfuture research."}

To\nthis end, we present WUGNECTIVES, a dataset of 8,880 stimuli that evaluates\nLMs' inferences about novel entities in contexts where connectives link the\nentities to particular attributes. On investigating 17 different LMs at various\nscales, and training regimens, we found that tuning an LM to show reasoning\nbehavior yields noteworthy improvements on most connectives. At the same time,\nthere was a large variation in LMs' overall performance across connective type,\nwith all models systematically struggling on connectives that express a\nconcessive meaning. Our findings pave the way for more nuanced investigations\ninto the functional role of language cues as captured by LMs. We release\nWUGNECTIVES at https://github.com/sheffwb/wugnectives."}

To streamline this\nprocess and reduce the reliance on human effort, we introduce Automatic\nPromotion (AutoPR), a novel task that transforms research papers into accurate,\nengaging, and timely public content. To enable rigorous evaluation, we release\nPRBench, a multimodal benchmark that links 512 peer-reviewed articles to\nhigh-quality promotional posts, assessing systems along three axes: Fidelity\n(accuracy and tone), Engagement (audience targeting and appeal), and Alignment\n(timing and channel optimization). We also introduce PRAgent, a multi-agent\nframework that automates AutoPR in three stages: content extraction with\nmultimodal preparation, collaborative synthesis for polished outputs, and\nplatform-specific adaptation to optimize norms, tone, and tagging for maximum\nreach. When compared to direct LLM pipelines on PRBench, PRAgent demonstrates\nsubstantial improvements, including a 604% increase in total watch time, a 438%\nrise in likes, and at least a 2.9x boost in overall engagement. Ablation\nstudies show that platform modeling and targeted promotion contribute the most\nto these gains. Our results position AutoPR as a tractable, measurable research\nproblem and provide a roadmap for scalable, impactful automated scholarly\ncommunication."}

However, their expert-level abilities in math and coding\ncontrast sharply with their performance in long-horizon, interactive tasks such\nas web navigation and computer/phone-use. Inspired by literature on human\ncognition, we argue that current AI agents need ''vicarious trial and error'' -\nthe capacity to mentally simulate alternative futures before acting - in order\nto enhance their understanding and performance in complex interactive\nenvironments. We introduce Dyna-Mind, a two-stage training framework that\nexplicitly teaches (V)LM agents to integrate such simulation into their\nreasoning. In stage 1, we introduce Reasoning with Simulations (ReSim), which\ntrains the agent to generate structured reasoning traces from expanded search\ntrees built from real experience gathered through environment interactions.\nReSim thus grounds the agent's reasoning in faithful world dynamics and equips\nit with the ability to anticipate future states in its reasoning. In stage 2,\nwe propose Dyna-GRPO, an online reinforcement learning method to further\nstrengthen the agent's simulation and decision-making ability by using both\noutcome rewards and intermediate states as feedback from real rollouts.\nExperiments on two synthetic benchmarks (Sokoban and ALFWorld) and one\nrealistic benchmark (AndroidWorld) demonstrate that (1) ReSim effectively\ninfuses simulation ability into AI agents, and (2) Dyna-GRPO leverages outcome\nand interaction-level signals to learn better policies for long-horizon,\nplanning-intensive tasks. Together, these results highlight the central role of\nsimulation in enabling AI agents to reason, plan, and act more effectively in\nthe ever more challenging environments."}

We present, for the first time, Mind-Paced\nSpeaking (MPS), a brain-inspired framework that enables high-fidelity,\nreal-time reasoning. Similar to how humans utilize distinct brain regions for\nthinking and responding, we propose a novel dual-brain approach, employing a\n\"Formulation Brain\" for high-level reasoning to pace and guide a separate\n\"Articulation Brain\" for fluent speech generation.

In this work, we\nintroduce Prompting Test-Time Scaling (P-TTS), a simple yet effective\ninference-time data augmentation strategy for enhancing LLM reasoning through\nfinetuning. Rather than collecting thousands or even millions of examples,\nP-TTS leverages a small pool of only 90 manually selected reasoning instances\nand systematically varies exemplar augmentation through principled instruction\nprompting intensities at test time to synthesize diverse reasoning trajectory\ncontexts. Then we finetune the various sizes of Qwen-2.5 models on P-TTS data.\nAcross a suite of mathematical reasoning AIME2024 & 25, MATH500, and\nGPQA-Diamond, our P-TTS-7B and 32B models outperform the prior competitive\nbaselines like S1 and S1.1 (1K-shot), achieving absolute accuracy gains of\n+26.66% and +30.00% on AIME'24 (7B), and +13.34% and +6.67% on AIME'25 (7B);\nP-TTS-32B yields gains of +23.33% and +16.63% on AIME'24, and +26.63% and\n+3.33% on AIME'25 (vs. S1 and S1.1, respectively), with comparable or better\nperformance on MATH500 and GPQA-Diamond. We further show that P-TTS enhances\nzero-shot generalization accuracy on out-of-domain reasoning benchmarks of\nGaokao, Kaoyan, OlympiadBench, AMC23, GradeSchoolMath, and Minerva. Our\nanalysis suggests that test-time scaling effectively explores the latent space\nof reasoning patterns, amplifying LLM problem-solving with minimal annotation\noverhead, and further unlocking the reasoning potential and capabilities of\nLLMs. Prompting Test-Time Scaling offers a practical, low-cost way to elicit\nLLM reasoning in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving domains."}
