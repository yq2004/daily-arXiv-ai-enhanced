Existing benchmarks largely overlook these complexities, focusing instead on clean or generic conversational audio. To bridge this gap, we present WearVox, the first benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate voice assistants in realistic wearable scenarios. WearVox comprises 3,842 multi-channel, egocentric audio recordings collected via AI glasses across five diverse tasks including Search-Grounded QA, Closed-Book QA, Side-Talk Rejection, Tool Calling, and Speech Translation, spanning a wide range of indoor and outdoor environments and acoustic conditions. Each recording is accompanied by rich metadata, enabling nuanced analysis of model performance under real-world constraints. We benchmark leading proprietary and open-source speech Large Language Models (SLLMs) and find that most real-time SLLMs achieve accuracies on WearVox ranging from 29% to 59%, with substantial performance degradation on noisy outdoor audio, underscoring the difficulty and realism of the benchmark. Additionally, we conduct a case study with two new SLLMs that perform inference with single-channel and multi-channel audio, demonstrating that multi-channel audio inputs significantly enhance model robustness to environmental noise and improve discrimination between device-directed and background speech. Our results highlight the critical importance of spatial audio cues for context-aware voice assistants and establish WearVox as a comprehensive testbed for advancing wearable voice AI research.", "AI": {"tldr": "WearVox\uff1a\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u8bed\u97f3\u52a9\u624b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b3842\u4e2a\u591a\u901a\u9053\u3001\u4ee5\u81ea\u6211\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u97f3\u9891\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u8986\u76d65\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u52a9\u624b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u52a9\u624b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5927\u591a\u5ffd\u7565\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\uff08\u5982AI\u773c\u955c\uff09\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u4ee5\u81ea\u6211\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u97f3\u9891\u53d7\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\u3001\u5feb\u901f\u5fae\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u9700\u8981\u533a\u5206\u8bbe\u5907\u5bfc\u5411\u8bed\u97f3\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7b49\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u573a\u666f\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u521b\u5efaWearVox\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b3842\u4e2a\u901a\u8fc7AI\u773c\u955c\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u591a\u901a\u9053\u3001\u4ee5\u81ea\u6211\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u97f3\u9891\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u641c\u7d22\u57fa\u7840\u95ee\u7b54\u3001\u95ed\u5377\u95ee\u7b54\u3001\u4fa7\u8c08\u62d2\u7edd\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u548c\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e94\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u591a\u79cd\u5ba4\u5185\u5916\u73af\u5883\u548c\u58f0\u5b66\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u9644\u5e26\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5143\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u6d41\u5b9e\u65f6\u8bed\u97f3\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728WearVox\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ec5\u4e3a29%-59%\uff0c\u5728\u5608\u6742\u6237\u5916\u97f3\u9891\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u591a\u901a\u9053\u97f3\u9891\u8f93\u5165\u76f8\u6bd4\u5355\u901a\u9053\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u8bbe\u5907\u5bfc\u5411\u8bed\u97f3\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u8bed\u97f3\u7684\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7a7a\u95f4\u97f3\u9891\u7ebf\u7d22\u5bf9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u8bed\u97f3\u52a9\u624b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0cWearVox\u4e3a\u63a8\u8fdb\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bed\u97f3AI\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Through comprehensive testing of 13 leading models, \\textsc{PCEval} provides the first reproducible and automatically validated empirical assessment of LLMs' ability to reason about fundamental hardware implementation constraints within a simulation environment. Our findings reveal that while LLMs perform well in code generation and logical circuit design, they struggle significantly with physical breadboard layout creation, particularly in managing proper pin connections and avoiding circuit errors. \\textsc{PCEval} advances our understanding of AI assistance in hardware-dependent computing environments and establishes a foundation for developing more effective tools to support physical computing education.", "AI": {"tldr": "PCEval \u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7269\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u9886\u57df\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u786c\u4ef6\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u786c\u4ef6\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7269\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u9886\u57df\uff08\u8f6f\u4ef6\u9700\u8981\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u786c\u4ef6\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u63a7\u5236\uff09\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u7f3a\u4e4f\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5728\u7269\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u7269\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PCEval\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u751f\u6210\u7535\u8def\u548c\u517c\u5bb9\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e0d\u540c\u9879\u76ee\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e8613\u4e2a\u9886\u5148\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d1\u73b0\uff1aLLM\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u7535\u8def\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7269\u7406\u9762\u5305\u677f\u5e03\u5c40\u521b\u5efa\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7ba1\u7406\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u5f15\u811a\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u907f\u514d\u7535\u8def\u9519\u8bef\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "conclusion": "PCEval\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9AI\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u4f9d\u8d56\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8f85\u52a9\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7269\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u6559\u80b2\u5de5\u5177\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

While Best-of-N and self-consistency methods show that aggregating multiple generations can improve performance, existing approaches typically rely on external evaluators, reward models, or exact string-match voting, limiting their applicability and efficiency. We propose Mode Extraction (ModeX), an evaluator-free Best-of-N selection framework that generalizes majority voting to open-ended text generation by identifying the modal output representing the dominant semantic consensus among generated texts. ModeX constructs a similarity graph over candidate generations and recursively applies spectral clustering to select a representative centroid, without requiring additional inference or auxiliary models. We further instantiate this selection principle as ModeX--Lite, an improved version of ModeX with early pruning for efficiency. Across open-ended tasks--including text summarization, code generation, and mathematical reasoning--our approaches consistently outperform standard single- and multi-path baselines, providing a computationally efficient solution for robust open-ended text generation.

Prevailing ranking models often rely on fragmented modules and hand-crafted features, limiting their ability to interpret complex user intent. This challenge is further amplified in location-based services such as food delivery, where user decisions are shaped by dynamic spatial, temporal, and individual contexts. To address these limitations, we propose a novel generative framework that reframes ranking as a context comprehension task, modeling heterogeneous signals in a unified architecture. Our architecture consists of two core components: the Generative Contextual Encoder (GCE) and the Generative Contextual Fusion (GCF). The GCE comprises three specialized modules: a Personalized Context Enhancer (PCE) for user-specific modeling, a Collective Context Enhancer (CCE) for group-level patterns, and a Dynamic Context Enhancer (DCE) for real-time situational adaptation. The GCF module then seamlessly integrates these contextual representations through low-rank adaptation. Extensive experiments confirm that our method achieves significant gains in critical business metrics, including click-through rate and platform revenue. We have successfully deployed our method on a large-scale food delivery advertising platform, demonstrating its substantial practical impact.

Existing dynamic-depth and layer-skipping methods reduce this cost, but often rely on auxiliary routing mechanisms or incur accuracy degradation when bypassed layers are left uncompensated. We present \\textbf{LoRA-Drop}, a plug-and-play inference framework that accelerates decoding by applying a \\emph{temporal compute schedule} to a fixed subset of intermediate layers: on most decoding steps, selected layers reuse the previous-token hidden state and apply a low-rank LoRA correction, while periodic \\emph{refresh} steps execute the full model to prevent drift. LoRA-Drop requires no routing network, is compatible with standard KV caching, and can reduce KV-cache footprint by skipping KV updates in droppable layers during LoRA steps and refreshing periodically. Across \\textbf{LLaMA2-7B}, \\textbf{LLaMA3-8B}, \\textbf{Qwen2.5-7B}, and \\textbf{Qwen2.5-14B}, LoRA-Drop achieves up to \\textbf{2.6$\\times$ faster decoding} and \\textbf{45--55\\% KV-cache reduction} while staying within \\textbf{0.5 percentage points (pp)} of baseline accuracy.

This study examines how the introduction of AI-generated reviews influences RS performance and business outcomes. We analyze two distinct pathways through which AI content can enter RSes: user-centric, in which individuals use AI tools to refine their reviews, and platform-centric, in which platforms generate synthetic reviews directly from structured metadata. Using a large-scale dataset of hotel reviews from TripAdvisor, we generate synthetic reviews using LLMs and evaluate their impact across the training and deployment phases of RSes. We find that AI-generated reviews differ systematically from human-authored reviews across multiple textual dimensions. Although both user- and platform-centric AI reviews enhance RS performance relative to models without textual data, models trained on human reviews consistently achieve superior performance, underscoring the quality of authentic human data.

While fact-checking can mitigate these errors, existing methods typically retrieve external evidence indiscriminately, overlooking the model's internal knowledge and potentially introducing irrelevant noise. Moreover, current systems lack targeted mechanisms to resolve specific uncertainties in the model's reasoning. Inspired by how humans fact-check, we argue that LLMs should adaptively decide whether to rely on internal knowledge or initiate retrieval based on their confidence in a given claim. We introduce Probabilistic Certainty and Consistency (PCC), a framework that estimates factual confidence by jointly modeling an LLM's probabilistic certainty and reasoning consistency. These confidence signals enable an adaptive verification strategy: the model answers directly when confident, triggers targeted retrieval when uncertain or inconsistent, and escalates to deep search when ambiguity is high. Our confidence-guided routing mechanism ensures that retrieval is invoked only when necessary, improving both efficiency and reliability. Extensive experiments across three challenging benchmarks show that PCC achieves better uncertainty quantification than verbalized confidence and consistently outperforms strong LLM-based fact-checking baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PCC generalizes well across various LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "PCC\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21LLM\u7684\u6982\u7387\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u5fc5\u8981\u65f6\u89e6\u53d1\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u52a0\u533a\u5206\u5730\u68c0\u7d22\u5916\u90e8\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u5165\u65e0\u5173\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u673a\u5236\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6982\u7387\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027(PCC)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21LLM\u7684\u6982\u7387\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u65f6\u76f4\u63a5\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6216\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u65f6\u89e6\u53d1\u5b9a\u5411\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u9ad8\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5ea6\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cPCC\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u53e3\u5934\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cPCC\u5728\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "PCC\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u7ed3\u5408\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Recently, platforms such as Amazon and Instagram have begun providing recommendation rationales to users, acknowledging their critical role in fostering trust and enhancing engagement; however, most existing systems still treat them as post-hoc artifacts. We propose an LLM-based recommender (LLM-Rec) that not only predicts items but also generates logically grounded rationales. Our approach leverages a self-annotated rationale dataset and instruction tuning in a rationale-first format, where the model generates an explanation before outputting the recommended item. By adopting this strategy and representing rationales in a chain-of-thought (CoT) style, LLM-Rec strengthens both interpretability and recommendation performance. Experiments on the Fashion and Scientific domains of the Amazon Review dataset demonstrate significant improvements over well-established baselines.

Recent advances in large language models enable agentic search and structured extraction from the web, but existing systems are frequently opaque, inflexible, or poorly suited to scientific data curation. Here we introduce DataParasite, an open-source, modular pipeline for scalable online data collection. DataParasite decomposes tabular curation tasks into independent, entity-level searches defined through lightweight configuration files and executed through a shared, task-agnostic python script. Crucially, the same pipeline can be repurposed to new tasks, including those without predefined entity lists, using only natural-language instructions.

Retrieval quality is pivotal, yet failures can arise at several stages: understanding user intent, choosing content types, finding candidates (recall), or ranking results. Meanwhile, sending and processing images is costly, making naive multimodal approaches impractical. We present FUSE: Failure-aware Usage of Subagent Evidence for MultiModal Search and Recommendation. FUSE replaces most raw-image prompting with a compact Grounded Design Representation (GDR): a selection aware JSON of canvas elements (image, text, shape, icon, video, logo), structure, styles, salient colors, and user selection provided by the Planner team. FUSE implements seven context budgeting strategies: comprehensive baseline prompting, context compression, chain-of-thought reasoning, mini-shot optimization, retrieval-augmented context, two-stage processing, and zero-shot minimalism. Finally, a pipeline attribution layer monitors system performance by converting subagent signals into simple checks: intent alignment, content-type/routing sanity, recall health (e.g., zero-hit and top-match strength), and ranking displacement analysis. We evaluate the seven context budgeting variants across 788 evaluation queries from diverse users and design templates (refer Figure 3). Our systematic evaluation reveals that Context Compression achieves optimal performance across all pipeline stages, with 93.3% intent accuracy, 86.8% routing success(with fallbacks), 99.4% recall, and 88.5% NDCG@5.

The classical graph recommendation model utilizes ID embedding to store essential collaborative information. However, this ID-based paradigm faces challenges in transferring to a new domain, making it hard to build a pre-trained graph recommendation model. This phenomenon primarily stems from two inherent challenges: (1) the non-transferability of ID embeddings due to isolated domain-specific ID spaces, and (2) structural incompatibility between heterogeneous interaction graphs across domains.\n  To address these issues, we propose TextBridgeGNN, a pre-training and fine-tuning framework that can effectively transfer knowledge from a pre-trained GNN to downstream tasks. We believe the key lies in how to build the relationship between domains. Specifically, TextBridgeGNN uses text as a semantic bridge to connect domains through multi-level graph propagation. During the pre-training stage, textual information is utilized to break the data islands formed by multiple domains, and hierarchical GNNs are designed to learn both domain-specific and domain-global knowledge with text features, ensuring the retention of collaborative signals and the enhancement of semantics. During the fine-tuning stage, a similarity transfer mechanism is proposed. This mechanism initializes ID embeddings in the target domain by transferring from semantically related nodes, successfully transferring the ID embeddings and graph pattern.\n  Experiments demonstrate that TextBridgeGNN outperforms existing methods in cross-domain, multi-domain, and training-free settings, highlighting its ability to integrate Pre-trained Language Model (PLM)-driven semantics with graph-based collaborative filtering without costly language model fine-tuning or real-time inference overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "TextBridgeGNN\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u6865\u63a5\u7684\u56fe\u63a8\u8350\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u8fde\u63a5\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u6709\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8eID\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u56fe\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e8eID\u7a7a\u95f4\u9694\u79bb\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u3002\u9700\u8981\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u591f\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "1) \u4f7f\u7528\u6587\u672c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u6865\u8fde\u63a5\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u56fe\u4f20\u64ad\u5b66\u4e60\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b2) \u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u5229\u7528\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u6253\u7834\u6570\u636e\u5b64\u5c9b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u5c42GNN\u4fdd\u7559\u534f\u540c\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u8bed\u4e49\uff1b3) \u5fae\u8c03\u9636\u6bb5\u63d0\u51fa\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8fc1\u79fb\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ece\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u8282\u70b9\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u57dfID\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eTextBridgeGNN\u5728\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u3001\u591a\u9886\u57df\u548c\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408PLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u56fe\u534f\u540c\u8fc7\u6ee4\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "TextBridgeGNN\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u56fe\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u6865\u63a5\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u56fe\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Transforming scientific papers into patent descriptions is particularly challenging due to their differing rhetorical styles and stringent legal requirements. Unlike black-box text-to-text approaches that struggle to model structural reasoning and legal constraints, we propose FlowPlan-G2P, a novel framework that mirrors the cognitive workflow of expert drafters by reformulating this task into three stages: (1) Concept Graph Induction, extracting technical entities and relationships into a directed graph via expert-like reasoning; (2) Paragraph and Section Planning, reorganizing the graph into coherent clusters aligned with canonical patent sections; and (3) Graph-Conditioned Generation, producing legally compliant paragraphs using section-specific subgraphs and tailored prompts. Experiments demonstrate that FlowPlan-G2P significantly improves logical coherence and legal compliance over end-to-end LLM baselines.

However, their performance depends heavily on the semantic quality of training data. In oncology, where precision and interpretability are vital, scalable methods for constructing structured knowledge bases are essential for effective fine-tuning. This study presents a pipeline for developing a lung cancer knowledge base using Open Information Extraction (OpenIE). The process includes: (1) identifying medical concepts with the MeSH thesaurus; (2) filtering open-access PubMed literature with permissive licenses (CC0); (3) extracting (subject, relation, object) triplets using OpenIE method; and (4) enriching triplet sets with Named Entity Recognition (NER) to ensure biomedical relevance. The resulting triplet sets provide a domain-specific, large-scale, and noise-aware resource for fine-tuning LLMs. We evaluated T5 models finetuned on this dataset through Supervised Semantic Fine-Tuning.

Conventional approaches often struggle with ambiguity, lexicon inconsistencies, and limited contextual understanding, particularly in multi-source news environments. Existing models typically treat sentiment as a secondary feature, reducing their ability to adapt to users' affective preferences. To address these limitations, this study develops an adaptive, sentiment-aware news recommendation framework by integrating hybrid sentiment analysis with reinforcement learning. Using the BBC News dataset, a hybrid sentiment model combines VADER, AFINN, TextBlob, and SentiWordNet scores to generate robust article-level sentiment estimates. Articles are categorised as positive, negative, or neutral, and these sentiment states are embedded within a Q-learning architecture to guide the agent in learning optimal recommendation policies. The proposed system effectively identifies and recommends articles with aligned emotional profiles while continuously improving personalisation through iterative Q-learning updates. The results demonstrate that coupling hybrid sentiment modelling with reinforcement learning provides a feasible, interpretable, and adaptive approach for user-centred news recommendation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6df7\u5408\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u95fb\u63a8\u8350\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u63a8\u8350\u60c5\u611f\u5339\u914d\u7684\u6587\u7ae0\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u63a8\u8350", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b0\u95fb\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6b67\u4e49\u3001\u8bcd\u5178\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u6709\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u591a\u6e90\u65b0\u95fb\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u60c5\u611f\u89c6\u4e3a\u6b21\u8981\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u7528\u6237\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u504f\u597d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u60c5\u611f\u611f\u77e5\u65b0\u95fb\u63a8\u8350\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6df7\u5408\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u4f7f\u7528BBC News\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u60c5\u611f\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u5408VADER\u3001AFINN\u3001TextBlob\u548cSentiWordNet\u5206\u6570\u751f\u6210\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6587\u7ae0\u7ea7\u60c5\u611f\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u5206\u4e3a\u79ef\u6781\u3001\u6d88\u6781\u6216\u4e2d\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u60c5\u611f\u72b6\u6001\u5d4c\u5165Q-learning\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u4f18\u63a8\u8350\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u63a8\u8350\u60c5\u611f\u5339\u914d\u7684\u6587\u7ae0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3Q-learning\u66f4\u65b0\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u63a8\u8350\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u60c5\u611f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u4e3a\u4ee5\u7528\u6237\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u65b0\u95fb\u63a8\u8350\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6df7\u5408\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u611f\u77e5\u65b0\u95fb\u63a8\u8350\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002"}}

The experimented models include BERT-based models (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and DeBERTa), ensemble models integrating embeddings from multiple encoder models, and ensemble models of feature-based supervised machine learning models, including Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and Light Gradient Boosting Machine. We trained, validated, and tested each model on a dataset of 17,307 essays, with an 80%/10%/10% split, and evaluated model performance using Quadratic Weighted Kappa.

While recent Generative Graph Models (e.g., HiGPT, OFA) demonstrate promising semantic capabilities, their prohibitive inference latency (often exceeding 13 minutes per 1,000 requests) and massive computational costs render them practically undeployable for real-time, million-scale applications. To bridge this gap between generative quality and industrial scalability, we propose TAG-HGT, a cost-effective neuro-symbolic framework. Adopting a decoupled \"Semantics-First, Structure-Refined\" paradigm, TAG-HGT utilizes a frozen Large Language Model (DeepSeek-V3) as an offline semantic factory and distills its knowledge into a lightweight Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT) via Cross-View Contrastive Learning (CVCL). We present a key insight: while LLM semantics provide necessary global recall, structural signals offer the critical local discrimination needed to distinguish valid collaborators from semantically similar but socially unreachable strangers in dense embedding spaces. Validated under a strict Time-Machine Protocol on the massive OpenAlex dataset, TAG-HGT achieves a SOTA System Recall@10 of 91.97%, outperforming structure-only baselines by 20.7%. Most significantly, from an industrial perspective, TAG-HGT reduces inference latency by five orders of magnitude ($4.5 \\times 10^{5}\\times$) compared to generative baselines (from 780s down to 1.73 ms), and slashes inference costs from $\\sim$$1.50 to $<$$0.001 per 1k queries.

A Cost- and Latency-Aware Benchmark", "comment": null, "summary": "Modern large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on inference-time planning and external tools to improve reasoning. We benchmark this behavior on two real-world settings: event-centric question answering over graph-structured knowledge (Event-QA) and persuasive response generation in Reddit ChangeMyView (CMV). Using LangChain and LangGraph, we compare a one-shot baseline against a plan--execute--replan agent equipped with task-specific tools (DBpedia SPARQL/lookup/schema exploration, Wikipedia-focused retrieval, and topical web search). We evaluate on 60 examples each from Event-QA and CMV (3 splits of 20), and report both mean end-to-end latency and per-example token cost estimates. We evaluate GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini under identical workflows and report accuracy and end-to-end latency. On Event-QA, the best tool-augmented configuration improves accuracy (e.g., 47.5\\% $\\rightarrow$ 67.5\\% for GPT-4o) while increasing latency by orders of magnitude ($\\sim$8s $\\rightarrow$ $\\sim$317s per example). On CMV, one-shot prompting is strongest (e.g., GPT-4o-mini achieves 75\\% at $\\sim$6s), and planning+search increases latency substantially without consistent gains. However, complex multi-tool orchestration exposes failure modes where the smaller model degrades.

Existing approaches predominantly aim to infer the diversity of user preferences from observed user feedback. Nonetheless, due to inherent data biases, the observed data may not fully reflect user interests, where underexplored preferences can be overwhelmed or remain unmanifested. Failing to capture these preferences can lead to suboptimal diversity in recommendations. To fill this gap, this work aims to study diversified recommendation from a data-bias perspective. Inspired by the outstanding performance of large language models (LLMs) in zero-shot inference leveraging world knowledge, we propose a novel approach that utilizes LLMs' expertise to uncover underexplored user preferences from observed behavior, ultimately providing diverse and relevant recommendations. To achieve this, we first introduce Tree of Preferences (ToP), an innovative structure constructed to model user preferences from coarse to fine. ToP enables LLMs to systematically reason over the user's rationale behind their behavior, thereby uncovering their underexplored preferences. To guide diversified recommendations using uncovered preferences, we adopt a data-centric approach, identifying candidate items that match user preferences and generating synthetic interactions that reflect underexplored preferences. These interactions are integrated to train a general recommender for diversification. Moreover, we scale up overall efficiency by dynamically selecting influential users during optimization. Extensive evaluations of both diversity and relevance show that our approach outperforms existing methods in most cases and achieves near-optimal performance in others, with reasonable inference latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6316\u6398\u7528\u6237\u6f5c\u5728\u504f\u597d\u3001\u89e3\u51b3\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u504f\u597d\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u4ea4\u4e92\u6570\u636e\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3b\u8981\u4ece\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u4e2d\u63a8\u65ad\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u53cd\u6620\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u504f\u597d\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u6216\u672a\u663e\u73b0\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u9020\u6210\u63a8\u8350\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u504f\u597d\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u4ece\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\uff1b2\uff09\u5229\u7528LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u6316\u6398\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u504f\u597d\uff1b3\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u4ee5\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5339\u914d\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5019\u9009\u7269\u54c1\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u53cd\u6620\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5408\u6210\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b4\uff09\u6574\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4ea4\u4e92\u8bad\u7ec3\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u8350\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6837\u5316\uff1b5\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7684\u7528\u6237\u4f18\u5316\u6574\u4f53\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5408\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u504f\u5dee\u89c6\u89d2\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u591a\u6837\u5316\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6316\u6398\u7528\u6237\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u3001\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This narrow focus prevents current benchmarks from revealing systematic reasoning failures, factual blind spots, and robustness limitations of modern LLMs. To bridge this gap, we present FactArena, a fully automated arena-style evaluation framework that conducts comprehensive, stage-wise benchmarking of LLMs across the complete fact-checking pipeline. FactArena integrates three key components: (i) an LLM-driven fact-checking process that standardizes claim decomposition, evidence retrieval via tool-augmented interactions, and justification-based verdict prediction; (ii) an arena-styled judgment mechanism guided by consolidated reference guidelines to ensure unbiased and consistent pairwise comparisons across heterogeneous judge agents; and (iii) an arena-driven claim-evolution module that adaptively generates more challenging and semantically controlled claims to probe LLMs' factual robustness beyond fixed seed data. Across 16 state-of-the-art LLMs spanning seven model families, FactArena produces stable and interpretable rankings. Our analyses further reveal significant discrepancies between static claim-verification accuracy and end-to-end fact-checking competence, highlighting the necessity of holistic evaluation. The proposed framework offers a scalable and trustworthy paradigm for diagnosing LLMs' factual reasoning, guiding future model development, and advancing the reliable deployment of LLMs in safety-critical fact-checking applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "FactArena\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u7ade\u6280\u573a\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u9762\u3001\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u5730\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b8c\u6574\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u58f0\u660e\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u58f0\u660e\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u8bc1\u636e\u68c0\u7d22\uff09\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u72ed\u9698\u7684\u7126\u70b9\u4f7f\u5f97\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u73b0\u4ee3LLMs\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u5931\u8d25\u3001\u4e8b\u5b9e\u76f2\u70b9\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "FactArena\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1\uff09LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u58f0\u660e\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u901a\u8fc7\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc1\u636e\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u7406\u7531\u7684\u88c1\u51b3\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b2\uff09\u7ade\u6280\u573a\u5f0f\u5224\u65ad\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9075\u5faa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u5224\u65ad\u4ee3\u7406\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u504f\u4e14\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f83\uff1b3\uff09\u7ade\u6280\u573a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u58f0\u660e\u6f14\u5316\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u58f0\u660e\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a2\u6d4bLLMs\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u79cd\u5b50\u6570\u636e\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6db5\u76d6\u4e03\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u768416\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdbLLMs\u4e0a\uff0cFactArena\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6392\u540d\u3002\u5206\u6790\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9759\u6001\u58f0\u660e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8bca\u65adLLMs\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u672a\u6765\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8LLMs\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

Creators, in turn, adapt their content to align with users preferences and enhance their popularity. At the same time, users preferences evolve under the influence of both suggested content from the recommender system and content shared within their social circles. This feedback loop generates a complex interplay between users, creators, and recommender algorithms, which is the key cause of filter bubbles and opinion polarization. We develop a social network-aware recommender system that explicitly accounts for this user-creators feedback interaction and strategically exploits the topology of the user's own social network to promote diversification. Our approach highlights how accounting for and exploiting user's social network in the recommender system design is crucial to mediate filter bubble effects while balancing content diversity with personalization. Provably, opinion clusterization is positively correlated with the influence of recommended content on user opinions. Ultimately, the proposed approach shows the power of socially-aware recommender systems in combating opinion polarization and clusterization phenomena.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8003\u8651\u7528\u6237\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u7528\u6237\u793e\u4ea4\u5173\u7cfb\u6765\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5185\u5bb9\u591a\u6837\u5316\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6c14\u6ce1\u548c\u610f\u89c1\u6781\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u5339\u914d\u7528\u6237\u4e0e\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u5185\u5bb9\u6765\u6700\u5927\u5316\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\uff0c\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u5219\u8c03\u6574\u5185\u5bb9\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u53c8\u53d7\u5230\u63a8\u8350\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u793e\u4ea4\u5708\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u5171\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6c14\u6ce1\u548c\u610f\u89c1\u6781\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u591f\u8003\u8651\u8fd9\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u8003\u8651\u7528\u6237-\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u53cd\u9988\u4e92\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u6218\u7565\u6027\u5730\u5229\u7528\u7528\u6237\u81ea\u8eab\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5185\u5bb9\u591a\u6837\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u610f\u89c1\u96c6\u7fa4\u5316\u4e0e\u63a8\u8350\u5185\u5bb9\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u610f\u89c1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u5448\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u793e\u4ea4\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u610f\u89c1\u6781\u5316\u548c\u96c6\u7fa4\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u8003\u8651\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7528\u6237\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8c03\u8282\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6c14\u6ce1\u6548\u5e94\u3001\u5e73\u8861\u5185\u5bb9\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u793e\u4ea4\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u610f\u89c1\u6781\u5316\u548c\u96c6\u7fa4\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

LATS reformulates jailbreaking as a breadth-first tree search over multi-turn dialogues, where each node incrementally injects missing content words from the attack goal into benign prompts. Evaluations on AdvBench and HarmBench demonstrate that LATS achieves 97-100% ASR on latest GPT, Claude, and Llama models with an average of only ~6.4 queries, compared to 20+ queries required by other methods.

Frequently retrieved items are consolidated and protected from forgetting, while rarely used items gradually decay, inspired by cognitive consolidation and forgetting principles. On a lightweight retrieval benchmark, ARM reaches near state-of-the-art performance (e.g., NDCG@5 $\\approx$ 0.940, Recall@5 $=1.000$) with only $\\sim$22M parameters in the embedding layer, achieving the best efficiency among ultra-efficient models ($<$25M parameters). In addition, we compare static vs. dynamic RAG combinations across Llama 3.1 and GPT-4o. Llama 3.1 with static RAG achieves the highest key-term coverage (67.2\\%) at moderate latency, while GPT-4o with a dynamic selective retrieval policy attains the fastest responses (8.2s on average) with competitive coverage (58.7\\%).

While many believe that LLMs do not memorize much of their training data, recent work shows that substantial amounts of copyrighted text can be extracted from open-weight models. However, it remains an open question if similar extraction is feasible for production LLMs, given the safety measures these systems implement. We investigate this question using a two-phase procedure: (1) an initial probe to test for extraction feasibility, which sometimes uses a Best-of-N (BoN) jailbreak, followed by (2) iterative continuation prompts to attempt to extract the book. We evaluate our procedure on four production LLMs -- Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Grok 3 -- and we measure extraction success with a score computed from a block-based approximation of longest common substring (nv-recall). With different per-LLM experimental configurations, we were able to extract varying amounts of text. For the Phase 1 probe, it was unnecessary to jailbreak Gemini 2.5 Pro and Grok 3 to extract text (e.g, nv-recall of 76.8% and 70.3%, respectively, for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone), while it was necessary for Claude 3.7 Sonnet and GPT-4.1. In some cases, jailbroken Claude 3.7 Sonnet outputs entire books near-verbatim (e.g., nv-recall=95.8%). GPT-4.1 requires significantly more BoN attempts (e.g., 20X), and eventually refuses to continue (e.g., nv-recall=4.0%).

To mitigate this issue, memory-based continual learning has been widely adopted for IR. However, existing methods rely on a fixed set of queries with ground-truth relevant documents, which limits generalization to unseen queries and documents, making them impractical for real-world applications. To enable more effective learning with unseen topics of a new corpus without ground-truth labels, we propose CREAM, a self-supervised framework for memory-based continual retrieval. CREAM captures the evolving semantics of streaming queries and documents into dynamically structured soft memory and leverages it to adapt to both seen and unseen topics in an unsupervised setting. We realize this through three key techniques: fine-grained similarity estimation, regularized cluster prototyping, and stratified coreset sampling.

However, their ever-growing scale introduces significant barriers to real-world deployment, including substantial computational overhead, memory footprint, and inference latency. While model pruning presents a viable solution to these challenges, existing unstructured pruning techniques often yield irregular sparsity patterns that necessitate specialized hardware or software support. In this work, we explore structured pruning, which eliminates entire architectural components and maintains compatibility with standard hardware accelerators. We introduce a novel structured pruning framework that leverages a hybrid multi-domain calibration set and an iterative calibration strategy to effectively identify and remove redundant channels.

Recent advancements show that incorporating propagation dynamics can significantly enhance detection performance compared to previous content-only approaches. However, this remains challenging at early stages due to the absence of observable propagation signals. To address this limitation, we propose AVOID, an \\underline{a}gent-driven \\underline{v}irtual pr\\underline{o}pagat\\underline{i}on for early fake news \\underline{d}etection. AVOID reformulates early detection as a new paradigm of evidence generation, where propagation signals are actively simulated rather than passively observed. Leveraging LLM-powered agents with differentiated roles and data-driven personas, AVOID realistically constructs early-stage diffusion behaviors without requiring real propagation data. The resulting virtual trajectories provide complementary social evidence that enriches content-based detection, while a denoising-guided fusion strategy aligns simulated propagation with content semantics. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that AVOID consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting the effectiveness and practical value of virtual propagation augmentation for early fake news detection.

On many entertainment platforms such as Netflix, users typically interact with a wide range of titles, each represented by an artwork. Since users have diverse preferences, an artwork that appeals to one type of user may not resonate with another with different preferences. Given this user heterogeneity, our work explores the novel problem of personalized artwork recommendations according to diverse user preferences. Similar to the multi-dimensional nature of users' tastes, titles contain different themes and tones that may appeal to different viewers. For example, the same title might feature both heartfelt family drama and intense action scenes. Users who prefer romantic content may like the artwork emphasizing emotional warmth between the characters, while those who prefer action thrillers may find high-intensity action scenes more intriguing. Rather than a one-size-fits-all approach, we conduct post-training of pre-trained LLMs to make personalized artwork recommendations, selecting the most preferred visual representation of a title for each user and thereby improving user satisfaction and engagement. Our experimental results with Llama 3.1 8B models (trained on a dataset of 110K data points and evaluated on 5K held-out user-title pairs) show that the post-trained LLMs achieve 3-5\\% improvements over the Netflix production model, suggesting a promising direction for granular personalized recommendations using LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u827a\u672f\u54c1\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5408\u9002\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5448\u73b0\uff0c\u5728Netflix\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e863-5%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u5a31\u4e50\u5e73\u53f0\uff08\u5982Netflix\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u827a\u672f\u54c1\uff08\u5c01\u9762\u56fe\uff09\u5177\u6709\u591a\u6837\u5316\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u540c\u4e00\u4f5c\u54c1\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89c9\u5448\u73b0\u53ef\u80fd\u5438\u5f15\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u7528\u6237\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u4e00\u5200\u5207\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u5f0f\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3LLM\uff08Llama 3.1 8B\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7528\u6237\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5408\u9002\u7684\u4f5c\u54c1\u89c6\u89c9\u5448\u73b0\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4e8611\u4e07\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c5\u5343\u7528\u6237-\u4f5c\u54c1\u5bf9\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684LLM\u5728\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u827a\u672f\u54c1\u63a8\u8350\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6bd4Netflix\u751f\u4ea7\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u4e863-5%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86LLM\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u827a\u672f\u54c1\u63a8\u8350\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u7528\u6237\u591a\u6837\u5316\u504f\u597d\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5448\u73b0\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7528\u6237\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Hate speech detection, on the other hand, aims to recognize content that incites violence, discrimination, or hostility toward individuals or groups based on attributes such as race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion. Both tasks play a critical role in online content moderation by enabling the detection and mitigation of harmful or offensive material, thereby contributing to safer digital environments. In this study, we examine the performance of three transformer-based models: BERT-base-multilingual-cased, RoBERTa-base, and XLM-RoBERTa-base with the first eight layers frozen, for multilingual sentiment analysis and hate speech detection. The evaluation is conducted across five languages: English, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and French. The models are compared using standard performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. To enhance model interpretability and provide deeper insight into prediction behavior, we integrate the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) framework, which highlights the contribution of individual words to the models decisions.

While extended user-engagement histories can improve the prediction of user interests, it is equally important to embed activity sequences from multiple sources to ensure freshness of user and ad-representations, following scaling law principles. In this paper, we present a novel three-dimensional framework for enhancing user-ad representations without increasing model inference or serving complexity. The first dimension examines the impact of incorporating diverse event sources, the second considers the benefits of longer user histories, and the third focuses on enriching data with additional event attributes and multi-modal embeddings. We assess the return on investment (ROI) of our source enrichment framework by comparing organic user engagement sources, such as content viewing, with ad-impression sources. The proposed method can boost the area under curve (AUC) and the slope of scaling curves for ad-impression sources by 1.56 to 2 times compared to organic usage sources even for short online-sequence lengths of 100 to 10K. Additionally, click-through rate (CTR) prediction improves by 0.56% AUC over the baseline production ad-recommendation system when using enriched ad-impression event sources, leading to improved sequence scaling resolutions for longer and offline user-ad representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e09\u7ef4\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u7528\u6237-\u5e7f\u544a\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6e90\u3001\u5ef6\u957f\u7528\u6237\u5386\u53f2\u3001\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5e7f\u544a\u63a8\u8350\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5546\u4e1a\u5e7f\u544a\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6837\u5316\u548c\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u6765\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u5386\u53f2\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u540c\u6837\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\u5d4c\u5165\u6765\u81ea\u591a\u4e2a\u6765\u6e90\u7684\u6d3b\u52a8\u5e8f\u5217\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u7528\u6237\u548c\u5e7f\u544a\u8868\u793a\u7684\u65b0\u9c9c\u5ea6\uff0c\u9075\u5faa\u6269\u5c55\u5b9a\u5f8b\u539f\u5219\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6e90\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8003\u8651\u66f4\u957f\u7528\u6237\u5386\u53f2\u7684\u76ca\u5904\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e09\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u989d\u5916\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u6765\u4e30\u5bcc\u6570\u636e\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u6709\u673a\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u6e90\uff08\u5982\u5185\u5bb9\u6d4f\u89c8\uff09\u4e0e\u5e7f\u544a\u66dd\u5149\u6e90\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6295\u8d44\u56de\u62a5\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u5e7f\u544a\u66dd\u5149\u6e90\u7684AUC\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u66f2\u7ebf\u659c\u7387\u6bd4\u6709\u673a\u4f7f\u7528\u6e90\u63d0\u9ad81.56\u52302\u500d\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728100\u523010K\u7684\u77ed\u5728\u7ebf\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u3002\u5f53\u4f7f\u7528\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5e7f\u544a\u66dd\u5149\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6e90\u65f6\uff0c\u70b9\u51fb\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u7684AUC\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u751f\u4ea7\u5e7f\u544a\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u9ad80.56%\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u957f\u548c\u79bb\u7ebf\u7684\u7528\u6237-\u5e7f\u544a\u8868\u793a\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u5e8f\u5217\u6269\u5c55\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u6e90\u4e30\u5bcc\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u7528\u6237-\u5e7f\u544a\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5e7f\u544a\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6216\u670d\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5546\u4e1a\u5e7f\u544a\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This project investigates the adversarial robustness of transformer models on the AddSent adversarial dataset through systematic experimentation across model scales and targeted mitigation strategies. We perform comprehensive multi-level error analysis using five complementary categorization schemes, identifying negation confusion and entity substitution as the primary failure modes. Through systematic evaluation of adversarial fine-tuning ratios, we identify 80% clean + 20% adversarial data as optimal. Data augmentation experiments reveal a capacity bottleneck in small models.

Different from traditional e-commerce, live-streaming e-commerce shifts the focus from products to streamers, which requires ranking mechanism to balance both purchases and user-streamer interactions for long-term ecology. To trade off multiple objectives, a popular solution is to build an ensemble model to integrate multi-objective scores into a unified score. The ensemble model is usually supervised by multiple independent binary classification losses of all objectives. However, this paradigm suffers from two inherent limitations. First, the optimization direction of the binary classification task is misaligned with the ranking task (evaluated by AUC). Second, this paradigm overlooks the alignment between objectives, e.g., comment and buy behaviors are partially dependent which can be revealed in labels correlations. The model can achieve better trade-offs if it learns the aligned parts of ranking abilities among different objectives.\n  To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel multi-objective ensemble framework HarmonRank to fulfill both alignment to the ranking task and alignment among objectives. For alignment to ranking, we formulate ranking metric AUC as a rank-sum problem and utilize differentiable ranking techniques for ranking-oriented optimization. For inter-objective alignment, we change the original one-step ensemble paradigm to a two-step relation-aware ensemble scheme.\n  Extensive offline experiments results on two industrial datasets and online experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Based on this design, we develop an improved knowledge distillation chain-style model and leverage it to analyze and constrain the reasoning process of LLMs, thereby improving inference accuracy. We empirically evaluate the proposed approach using GPT-4 and LLaMA-3.3 on multiple public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating code modules significantly enhances the model's ability to capture contextual information and effectively mitigates prompt-induced hallucinations.

Although reasons for this are multi-faceted, the sparseness of context and the limited data basis of up to ten suggestions per search query pose the most significant problem in identifying bias in search query suggestions. The most proven method to reduce sparseness and improve the validity of bias identification of search query suggestions so far is to consider suggestions from subsequent searches over time for the same query. This work presents a new, alternative approach to search query bias identification that includes less high-level suggestions to deepen the data basis of bias analyses. We employ recursive algorithm interrogation techniques and create suggestion trees that enable access to more subliminal search query suggestions.

A central question persists: Why is human language hierarchical? In this study, we show that hierarchization optimally solves the challenge of our limited working memory capacity. We established a likelihood function that quantifies how well the average number of units according to the language processing mechanisms aligns with human working memory capacity (WMC) in a direct fashion. The maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of this function, tehta_MLE, turns out to be the mean of units. Through computational simulations of symbol sequences and validation analyses of natural language sentences, we uncover that compared to linear processing, hierarchical processing far surpasses it in constraining the tehta_MLE values under the human WMC limit, along with the increase of sequence/sentence length successfully. It also shows a converging pattern related to children's WMC development. These results suggest that constructing hierarchical structures optimizes the processing efficiency of sequential language input while staying within memory constraints, genuinely explaining the universal hierarchical nature of human language.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5c42\u7ea7\u5904\u7406\u6bd4\u7ebf\u6027\u5904\u7406\u66f4\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7ea6\u675f\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5355\u5143\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5bb9\u91cf\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bed\u8a00\u666e\u904d\u5177\u6709\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bed\u8a00\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f46\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u8bed\u8a00\u662f\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684\uff1f\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7a76\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u662f\u5426\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5bb9\u91cf\u6709\u5173\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c42\u7ea7\u5904\u7406\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u5355\u5143\u6570\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5bb9\u91cf\u5339\u914d\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u4f3c\u7136\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u62df\u7b26\u53f7\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u53e5\u5b50\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5c42\u7ea7\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u7ebf\u6027\u5904\u7406\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u5355\u5143\u6570\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5c42\u7ea7\u5904\u7406\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u03b8_MLE\u503c\uff08\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5355\u5143\u5e73\u5747\u6570\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u8fdc\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5bb9\u91cf\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e14\u968f\u7740\u5e8f\u5217/\u53e5\u5b50\u957f\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u4f18\u52bf\u66f4\u52a0\u660e\u663e\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8fd8\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4e0e\u513f\u7ae5\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u53d1\u5c55\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6784\u5efa\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u5e8f\u5217\u8bed\u8a00\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u5904\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5728\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7ea6\u675f\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0c\u8fd9\u771f\u6b63\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bed\u8a00\u666e\u904d\u5177\u6709\u5c42\u7ea7\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002"}}

Recent latent reasoning methods have shown promise by extending test-time computation through multi-step reasoning, yet they exclusively rely on depth-level scaling along a single trajectory, suffering from diminishing returns as reasoning depth increases. To address this limitation, we propose \\textbf{Parallel Latent Reasoning (PLR)}, a novel framework that pioneers width-level computational scaling by exploring multiple diverse reasoning trajectories simultaneously. PLR constructs parallel reasoning streams through learnable trigger tokens in continuous latent space, preserves diversity across streams via global reasoning regularization, and adaptively synthesizes multi-stream outputs through mixture-of-reasoning-streams aggregation. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that PLR substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining real-time inference efficiency.

To resolve this challenge, we propose an efficient approach to fine-tune small language models (SLMs) for accurate relevance labeling, enabling high-throughput, domain-specific labeling comparable or even better in quality to that of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). To overcome the lack of high-quality and accessible datasets in the enterprise domain, our method leverages on synthetic data generation. Specifically, we employ an LLM to synthesize realistic enterprise queries from a seed document, apply BM25 to retrieve hard negatives, and use a teacher LLM to assign relevance scores. The resulting dataset is then distilled into an SLM, producing a compact relevance labeler. We evaluate our approach on a high-quality benchmark consisting of 923 enterprise query-document pairs annotated by trained human annotators, and show that the distilled SLM achieves agreement with human judgments on par with or better than the teacher LLM. Furthermore, our fine-tuned labeler substantially improves throughput, achieving 17 times increase while also being 19 times more cost-effective. This approach enables scalable and cost-effective relevance labeling for enterprise-scale retrieval applications, supporting rapid offline evaluation and iteration in real-world settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u84b8\u998f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6807\u6ce8\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6807\u6ce8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f01\u4e1a\u641c\u7d22\u9886\u57df\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u800c\u83b7\u53d6\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u4e14\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528LLM\u4ece\u79cd\u5b50\u6587\u6863\u751f\u6210\u4f01\u4e1a\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u7528BM25\u68c0\u7d22\u96be\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u6559\u5e08LLM\u5206\u914d\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5c06\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u5230SLM\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u84b8\u998f\u540e\u7684SLM\u5728923\u4e2a\u4f01\u4e1a\u67e5\u8be2-\u6587\u6863\u5bf9\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u6559\u5e08LLM\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u534717\u500d\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u63d0\u9ad819\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7\u68c0\u7d22\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u3002"}}

This approach, however, dilutes the subtle, localized signals of memorization, reducing attack effectiveness. We challenge this global-averaging paradigm, positing that membership signals are more pronounced within localized contexts. We introduce WBC (Window-Based Comparison), which exploits this insight through a sliding window approach with sign-based aggregation. Our method slides windows of varying sizes across text sequences, with each window casting a binary vote on membership based on loss comparisons between target and reference models. By ensembling votes across geometrically spaced window sizes, we capture memorization patterns from token-level artifacts to phrase-level structures. Extensive experiments across eleven datasets demonstrate that WBC substantially outperforms established baselines, achieving higher AUC scores and 2-3 times improvements in detection rates at low false positive thresholds. Our findings reveal that aggregating localized evidence is fundamentally more effective than global averaging, exposing critical privacy vulnerabilities in fine-tuned LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "WBC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u5c40\u90e8\u6bd4\u8f83\u635f\u5931\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u5168\u5c40\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u5982\u5e73\u5747\u635f\u5931\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u7a00\u91ca\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u5fae\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u6311\u6218\u8fd9\u79cd\u5168\u5c40\u5e73\u5747\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6210\u5458\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u66f4\u52a0\u660e\u663e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faWBC\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a97\u53e3\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b26\u53f7\u7684\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u4e0a\u6bd4\u8f83\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7a97\u53e3\u57fa\u4e8e\u635f\u5931\u6bd4\u8f83\u5bf9\u6210\u5458\u5173\u7cfb\u8fdb\u884c\u4e8c\u5143\u6295\u7968\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u95f4\u9694\u7684\u7a97\u53e3\u5927\u5c0f\u8fdb\u884c\u6295\u7968\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u4ece\u8bcd\u5143\u7ea7\u5230\u77ed\u8bed\u7ea7\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u572811\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cWBC\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684AUC\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u9608\u503c\u4e0b\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e862-3\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u805a\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u8bc1\u636e\u6bd4\u5168\u5c40\u5e73\u5747\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9690\u79c1\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Existing benchmarks primarily evaluate whether these agents successfully complete the final task, overlooking the intermediate reasoning stages that are crucial for effective decision-making. To address this gap, we propose EComStage, a unified benchmark for evaluating agent-capable LLMs across the comprehensive stage-wise reasoning process: Perception (understanding user intent), Planning (formulating an action plan), and Action (executing the decision). EComStage evaluates LLMs through seven separate representative tasks spanning diverse e-commerce scenarios, with all samples human-annotated and quality-checked. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus only on customer-oriented interactions, EComStage also evaluates merchant-oriented scenarios, including promotion management, content review, and operational support relevant to real-world applications. We evaluate a wide range of over 30 LLMs, spanning from 1B to over 200B parameters, including open-source models and closed-source APIs, revealing stage/orientation- specific strengths and weaknesses. Our results provide fine-grained, actionable insights for designing and optimizing LLM-based agents in real-world e-commerce settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "EComStage\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u4e2d\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u884c\u52a8\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5305\u542b7\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8630\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9636\u6bb5\u548c\u573a\u666f\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u4f18\u52a3\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3b\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u662f\u5426\u6210\u529f\u5b8c\u6210\u6700\u7ec8\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u6709\u6548\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEComStage\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u611f\u77e5\uff08\u7406\u89e3\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\uff09\u3001\u89c4\u5212\uff08\u5236\u5b9a\u884c\u52a8\u8ba1\u5212\uff09\u548c\u884c\u52a8\uff08\u6267\u884c\u51b3\u7b56\uff09\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u3002\u5305\u542b7\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u5ba2\u6237\u5bfc\u5411\u548c\u5546\u5bb6\u5bfc\u5411\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u6837\u672c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u68c0\u67e5\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8630\u591a\u4e2aLLM\uff081B\u5230200B+\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u9636\u6bb5\u548c\u573a\u666f\u5bfc\u5411\u4e0b\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u4f18\u52bf\u548c\u5f31\u70b9\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "EComStage\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u4e2d\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

MiMo-V2-Flash adopts a hybrid attention architecture that interleaves Sliding Window Attention (SWA) with global attention, with a 128-token sliding window under a 5:1 hybrid ratio. The model is pre-trained on 27 trillion tokens with Multi-Token Prediction (MTP), employing a native 32k context length and subsequently extended to 256k. To efficiently scale post-training compute, MiMo-V2-Flash introduces a novel Multi-Teacher On-Policy Distillation (MOPD) paradigm. In this framework, domain-specialized teachers (e.g., trained via large-scale reinforcement learning) provide dense and token-level reward, enabling the student model to perfectly master teacher expertise. MiMo-V2-Flash rivals top-tier open-weight models such as DeepSeek-V3.2 and Kimi-K2, despite using only 1/2 and 1/3 of their total parameters, respectively. During inference, by repurposing MTP as a draft model for speculative decoding, MiMo-V2-Flash achieves up to 3.6 acceptance length and 2.6x decoding speedup with three MTP layers.

Consequently, sparse attention has received increasing attention as a scalable alternative. However, existing sparse attention methods rely on coarse-grained semantic representations during block selection, which blur intra-block semantic boundaries and lead to the loss of critical information. To address this issue, we propose \\textbf{P}unctuation-aware \\textbf{H}ybrid \\textbf{S}parse \\textbf{A}ttention \\textbf{(PHSA)}, a natively trainable sparse attention framework that leverages punctuation tokens as semantic boundary anchors. Specifically, (1) we design a dual-branch aggregation mechanism that fuses global semantic representations with punctuation-enhanced boundary features, preserving the core semantic structure while introducing almost no additional computational overhead; (2) we introduce an extreme-sparsity-adaptive training and inference strategy that stabilizes model behavior under very low token activation ratios; Extensive experiments on general benchmarks and long-context evaluations demonstrate that PHSA consistently outperforms dense attention and state-of-the-art sparse attention baselines, including InfLLM v2. Specifically, for the 0.6B-parameter model with 32k-token input sequences, PHSA can reduce the information loss by 10.8\\% at a sparsity ratio of 97.3\\%.", "AI": {"tldr": "PHSA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u70b9\u7b26\u53f7\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u70b9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u8fb9\u754c\u951a\u70b9\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bc6\u96c6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bc6\u96c6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56e0\u4e8c\u6b21\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u5757\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4f1a\u6a21\u7cca\u5757\u5185\u8bed\u4e49\u8fb9\u754c\u5e76\u4e22\u5931\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6807\u70b9\u611f\u77e5\u6df7\u5408\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b(PHSA)\uff1a1)\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u805a\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u548c\u6807\u70b9\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2)\u5f15\u5165\u6781\u7aef\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f4e\u4ee4\u724c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u901a\u7528\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cPHSA\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bc6\u96c6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e0.6B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u548c32k\u4ee4\u724c\u8f93\u5165\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u572897.3%\u7a00\u758f\u6bd4\u4e0b\u80fd\u5c06\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u51cf\u5c1110.8%\u3002", "conclusion": "PHSA\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6807\u70b9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u8fb9\u754c\u951a\u70b9\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4e3a\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Comparative analyses between LLMs developed in China and the U.S. indicate that Chinese models generally outperform their U.S. counterparts on these tasks.

TiMem is characterized by three core properties: (1) temporal--hierarchical organization through TMT; (2) semantic-guided consolidation that enables memory integration across hierarchical levels without fine-tuning; and (3) complexity-aware memory recall that balances precision and efficiency across queries of varying complexity. Under a consistent evaluation setup, TiMem achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on both benchmarks, reaching 75.30% on LoCoMo and 76.88% on LongMemEval-S. It outperforms all evaluated baselines while reducing the recalled memory length by 52.20% on LoCoMo.

Methodological Considerations for Measuring Cultural Alignment in LLMs", "comment": "IJCNLP-AACL 2025", "summary": "Socio-demographic prompting (SDP) - prompting Large Language Models (LLMs) using demographic proxies to generate culturally aligned outputs - often shows LLM responses as stereotypical and biased. While effective in assessing LLMs' cultural competency, SDP is prone to confounding factors such as prompt sensitivity, decoding parameters, and the inherent difficulty of generation over discrimination tasks due to larger output spaces. These factors complicate interpretation, making it difficult to determine if the poor performance is due to bias or the task design. To address this, we use inverse socio-demographic prompting (ISDP), where we prompt LLMs to discriminate and predict the demographic proxy from actual and simulated user behavior from different users.

Despite this non-uniqueness, language models are typically trained using a single canonical longest-prefix tokenization. We formalize homotokens-alternative valid subword segmentations of the same lexical item-as a strictly meaning-preserving form of data augmentation. We introduce a lightweight training architecture that conditions canonical next-token prediction on sampled homotoken variants via an auxiliary causal encoder and block-causal cross-attention, without modifying the training objective or token interface. In data-constrained pretraining, homotoken augmentation consistently delays overfitting under repeated data exposure and improves generalization across diverse evaluation datasets. In multilingual fine-tuning, we find that the effectiveness of homotokens depends on tokenizer quality: gains are strongest when canonical tokens are highly compressed and diminish when the tokenizer already over-fragments the input.

Current long-context benchmarks often trade off scalability and realism: synthetic tasks underrepresent real-world complexity, while fully manual annotation is costly to scale to extreme lengths and diverse scenarios. We present LongBench Pro, a more realistic and comprehensive bilingual benchmark of 1,500 naturally occurring long-context samples in English and Chinese spanning 11 primary tasks and 25 secondary tasks, with input lengths from 8k to 256k tokens. LongBench Pro supports fine-grained analysis with task-specific metrics and a multi-dimensional taxonomy of context requirement (full vs. partial dependency), length (six levels), and difficulty (four levels calibrated by model performance). To balance quality with scalability, we propose a Human-Model Collaborative Construction pipeline: frontier LLMs draft challenging questions and reference answers, along with design rationales and solution processes, to reduce the cost of expert verification. Experts then rigorously validate correctness and refine problematic cases. Evaluating 46 widely used long-context LLMs on LongBench Pro yields three findings: (1) long-context optimization contributes more to long-context comprehension than parameter scaling; (2) effective context length is typically shorter than the claimed context length, with pronounced cross-lingual misalignment; and (3) the \"thinking\" paradigm helps primarily models trained with native reasoning, while mixed-thinking designs offer a promising Pareto trade-off.

Previous works have demonstrated promising results in applying LLM's towards compressing not only text, but also a wide range of multi-modal data. Despite the favorable performance achieved, there still remains several practical questions that pose a challenge towards replacing existing data compression algorithms with LLM's. In this work, we explore different methods to achieve a lower adjusted compression rate using LLM's as data compressors. In comparison to previous works, we were able to achieve a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) adjusted compression rate of around $18\\%$ on the enwik9 dataset without additional model training. Furthermore, we explore the use of LLM's in compressing non-English data, code data, byte stream sequences. We show that while LLM's excel in compressing data in text-dominant domains, their ability in compressing non-natural text sequences still remain competitive if configured in the right way.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5728enwik9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8618%\u7684\u8c03\u6574\u538b\u7f29\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u5b57\u8282\u6d41\u5e8f\u5217\u538b\u7f29\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660eLLM\u5728\u6587\u672c\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6311\u6218\u963b\u788d\u5176\u66ff\u4ee3\u73b0\u6709\u538b\u7f29\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u964d\u4f4e\u8c03\u6574\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1LLM\u5728\u975e\u82f1\u8bed\u6570\u636e\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5b57\u8282\u6d41\u5e8f\u5217\u538b\u7f29\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u4f18\u5316\u8c03\u6574\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u3002\u5bf9\u975e\u82f1\u8bed\u6570\u636e\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5b57\u8282\u6d41\u5e8f\u5217\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e13\u95e8\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728enwik9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ea618%\u7684\u8c03\u6574\u538b\u7f29\u7387\uff0c\u521b\u4e0b\u65b0\u7684SOTA\u8bb0\u5f55\u3002LLM\u5728\u6587\u672c\u4e3b\u5bfc\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u975e\u81ea\u7136\u6587\u672c\u5e8f\u5217\u538b\u7f29\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u5f53\u914d\u7f6e\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u5177\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6587\u672c\u9886\u57df\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u9002\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u4f18\u5316\uff0cLLM\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, different regional varieties often employ different scripts to write the same language, rendering speech recognition output also subject to non-determinism in the output script. To mitigate this problem, we show that script is linearly encoded in the activation space of multilingual speech models, and that modifying activations at inference time enables direct control over output script. We find the addition of such script vectors to activations at test time can induce script change even in unconventional language-script pairings (e.g. Italian in Cyrillic and Japanese in Latin script). We apply this approach to inducing post-hoc control over the script of speech recognition output, where we observe competitive performance across all model sizes of Whisper.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u811a\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u7ebf\u6027\u7f16\u7801\u4e8e\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5411\u91cf\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u63a7\u5236\u8f93\u51fa\u811a\u672c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u811a\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u97f3\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Whisper\uff09\u5728\u7f51\u9875\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6bcf\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u5305\u542b\u591a\u79cd\u533a\u57df\u53d8\u4f53\u3002\u4e0d\u540c\u533a\u57df\u53d8\u4f53\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u6587\u5b57\u4e66\u5199\u540c\u4e00\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u8f93\u51fa\u5b58\u5728\u811a\u672c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u79cd\u8f93\u51fa\u811a\u672c\u7684\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u811a\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5448\u7ebf\u6027\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4fee\u6539\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5411\u91cf\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u63a7\u5236\u8f93\u51fa\u811a\u672c\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6dfb\u52a0\u811a\u672c\u5411\u91cf\u5230\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u4e0d\u5e38\u89c4\u7684\u8bed\u8a00-\u811a\u672c\u914d\u5bf9\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u8bf1\u5bfc\u811a\u672c\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u811a\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5728Whisper\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0a\u90fd\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u811a\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7ebf\u6027\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5411\u91cf\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f93\u51fa\u811a\u672c\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u8f93\u51fa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u811a\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, a critical paradox persists within the current field: despite the empirical efficacy, our theoretical understanding of LLMs remains disproportionately nascent, forcing these systems to be treated largely as ``black boxes''. To address this theoretical fragmentation, this survey proposes a unified lifecycle-based taxonomy that organizes the research landscape into six distinct stages: Data Preparation, Model Preparation, Training, Alignment, Inference, and Evaluation. Within this framework, we provide a systematic review of the foundational theories and internal mechanisms driving LLM performance. Specifically, we analyze core theoretical issues such as the mathematical justification for data mixtures, the representational limits of various architectures, and the optimization dynamics of alignment algorithms. Moving beyond current best practices, we identify critical frontier challenges, including the theoretical limits of synthetic data self-improvement, the mathematical bounds of safety guarantees, and the mechanistic origins of emergent intelligence.

Despite each modelled language learner starting from a blank slate, the presence of a bottleneck limiting the number of utterances to which the learner is exposed can lead to the emergence of language that lacks ambiguity, is governed by grammatical rules, and is consistent over successive generations, that is, one that is expressive, compositional and stable. The recent introduction of a more computationally tractable and ecologically valid semi supervised iterated learning model, combining supervised and unsupervised learning within an autoencoder architecture, has enabled exploration of language transmission dynamics for much larger meaning-signal spaces. Here, for the first time, the model has been successfully applied to a language learning task involving the communication of much more complex meanings: seven-segment display images. Agents in this model are able to learn and transmit a language that is expressive: distinct codes are employed for all 128 glyphs; compositional: signal components consistently map to meaning components, and stable: the language does not change from generation to generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fed\u4ee3\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e03\u6bb5\u663e\u793a\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u590d\u6742\u610f\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u4f20\u9012\u5177\u6709\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u3001\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u8bed\u8a00\u4f20\u9012\u7ea6\u675f\u5982\u4f55\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8bed\u8a00\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u610f\u4e49\uff08\u4e03\u6bb5\u663e\u793a\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u8fed\u4ee3\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e03\u6bb5\u663e\u793a\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u4f20\u9012\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u8bed\u8a00\uff08128\u79cd\u5b57\u5f62\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7f16\u7801\uff09\u3001\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u4fe1\u53f7\u6210\u5206\u4e00\u81f4\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u610f\u4e49\u6210\u5206\uff09\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u4ee3\u9645\u95f4\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0d\u53d1\u751f\u53d8\u5316\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fed\u4ee3\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u590d\u6742\u610f\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u4f20\u9012\u7ea6\u675f\u80fd\u591f\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u3001\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8bed\u8a00\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u3002"}}

To further mitigate judgment hallucination, we propose a query-adaptive latent ensemble strategy that explicitly models heterogeneous model competence and interdependencies among LLMs, deriving a calibrated consensus decision.

We propose a controlled Knowledge Graph-based synthetic framework that generates text from symmetric/inverse triples, train GPT-style autoregressive models from scratch, and evaluate memorization, logical inference, and in-context generalization to unseen entities to address these questions. We find a sharp phase transition in which relational semantics emerge with sufficient logic-bearing supervision, even in shallow (2-3 layer) models, and that successful generalization aligns with stable intermediate-layer signals. Finally, order-matched forward/reverse tests and a diffusion baseline indicate that reversal failures are primarily driven by autoregressive order bias rather than deficient inversion semantics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u81ea\u56de\u5f52LLM\u5982\u4f55\u5b66\u4e60\u5173\u7cfb\u8bed\u4e49\u903b\u8f91\uff08\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u548c\u9006\u903b\u8f91\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u903b\u8f91\u76d1\u7763\u65f6\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6d45\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e5f\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u5173\u7cfb\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\uff0c\u800c\u53cd\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u5931\u8d25\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u987a\u5e8f\u504f\u5dee\u800c\u975e\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u56de\u5f52LLM\u5728\u9700\u8981\u8fde\u63a5\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u5b83\u4eec\u662f\u5426\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u4e86\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u8bed\u4e49\uff08\u5982\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u548c\u9006\u903b\u8f91\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u53cd\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u5931\u8d25\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5173\u7cfb\u8bed\u4e49\u8fd8\u662f\u81ea\u5de6\u5411\u53f3\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u504f\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u53d7\u63a7\u5408\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u5bf9\u79f0/\u9006\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3GPT\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3001\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09\u5728\u8db3\u591f\u903b\u8f91\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6d45\u5c42\uff082-3\u5c42\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e5f\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u5173\u7cfb\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\uff1b2\uff09\u6210\u529f\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u4fe1\u53f7\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b3\uff09\u987a\u5e8f\u5339\u914d\u7684\u524d\u5411/\u53cd\u5411\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u6269\u6563\u57fa\u7ebf\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u53cd\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u5931\u8d25\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u987a\u5e8f\u504f\u5dee\u800c\u975e\u9006\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u56de\u5f52LLM\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u5173\u7cfb\u903b\u8f91\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u53cd\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u5931\u8d25\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u987a\u5e8f\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5bf9\u5173\u7cfb\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u7f3a\u9677\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3LLM\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

While prior studies attribute this advantage to the superior English-centric capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we find that such measurements are significantly distorted by structural priors inherent in evaluation benchmarks. Specifically, we identify exposure bias and a gold availability prior-both driven by the disproportionate concentration of resources in English-as well as cultural priors rooted in topic locality, as factors that hinder accurate assessment of genuine language preference. To address these biases, we propose DeLP (Debiased Language Preference), a calibrated metric designed to explicitly factor out these structural confounds. Our analysis using DeLP reveals that the previously reported English preference is largely a byproduct of evidence distribution rather than an inherent model bias. Instead, we find that retrievers fundamentally favor monolingual alignment between the query and the document language. Building on this insight, we introduce DELTA (DEbiased Language preference-guided Text Augmentation), a lightweight and efficient mRAG framework that strategically leverages monolingual alignment to optimize cross-lingual retrieval and generation.

Two critical limitations in the field are addressed. First, individual detection methods exhibit complementary strengths and weaknesses depending on data characteristics, making method selection non-trivial and prone to suboptimal results. Second, automated, contextual explanations for detected changes are largely absent. The proposed ensemble method aggregates results from ten distinct changepoint detection algorithms, achieving superior performance and robustness compared to individual methods.

This study addresses the critical need for accurate digitization of Bahnar language documents through optical character recognition (OCR) technology. Digitizing scanned paper documents poses significant challenges, as degraded image quality from broken or blurred areas introduces considerable OCR errors that compromise information retrieval systems. We propose a comprehensive approach combining advanced table and non-table detection techniques with probability-based post-processing heuristics to enhance recognition accuracy. Our method first applies detection algorithms to improve input data quality, then employs probabilistic error correction on OCR output.

Adaptive self-consistency methods mitigate this issue by adjusting the sampling budget; however, they rely on count-based stopping rules that treat all responses equally, often leading to unnecessary sampling. We propose Reliability-Aware Adaptive Self-Consistency (ReASC), which addresses this limitation by reframing adaptive sampling from response counting to evidence sufficiency, leveraging response-level confidence for principled information aggregation. ReASC operates in two stages: a single-sample decision stage that resolves instances confidently answerable from a single response, and a reliability-aware accumulation stage that aggregates responses by jointly leveraging their frequency and confidence. Across five models and four datasets, ReASC consistently achieves the best accuracy-cost trade-off compared to existing baselines, yielding improved inference efficiency across model scales from 3B to 27B parameters.

However, CoT often becomes unnecessarily long, increasing computation cost without actual accuracy gains or sometimes even degrading performance, a phenomenon known as ``overthinking''. We propose a multi-stage efficient reasoning method that combines supervised fine-tuning -- via rejection sampling or reasoning trace reformatting -- with reinforcement learning using an adaptive length penalty. We introduce a lightweight reward function that penalizes tokens generated after the first correct answer but encouraging self-verification only when beneficial. We conduct a holistic evaluation across seven diverse reasoning tasks, analyzing the accuracy--response length trade-off. Our approach reduces response length by an average of 28\\% for 8B models and 40\\% for 32B models, while incurring only minor performance drops of 1.6 and 2.5 points, respectively. Despite its conceptual simplicity, it achieves a superior trade-off compared to more complex state-of-the-art efficient reasoning methods, scoring 76.6, in terms of the area under the Overthinking-Adjusted Accuracy curve ($\\text{AUC}_{\\text{OAA}}$) -- 5 points above the base model and 2.5 points above the second-best approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u957f\u5ea6\u60e9\u7f5a\u51cf\u5c11LLMs\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u601d\u8003\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u77ed\u54cd\u5e94\u957f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08\u5982\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5f80\u5f80\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u5197\u957f\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u589e\u52a0\u751a\u81f3\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u88ab\u79f0\u4e3a\"\u8fc7\u5ea6\u601d\u8003\"\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\u6216\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u91cd\u683c\u5f0f\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b2\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u957f\u5ea6\u60e9\u7f5a\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b3\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u60e9\u7f5a\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u540e\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u53ea\u5728\u6709\u76ca\u65f6\u9f13\u52b1\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff1a8B\u6a21\u578b\u54cd\u5e94\u957f\u5ea6\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c1128%\uff0c32B\u6a21\u578b\u51cf\u5c1140%\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4ec5\u8f7b\u5fae\u4e0b\u964d1.6\u548c2.5\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002\u5728\u8fc7\u5ea6\u601d\u8003\u8c03\u6574\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e0b\u9762\u79ef\uff08AUC_OAA\uff09\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5f97\u5206\u4e3a76.6\uff0c\u6bd4\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u9ad85\u5206\uff0c\u6bd4\u6b21\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad82.5\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6982\u5ff5\u7b80\u5355\u4f46\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u590d\u6742\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11LLMs\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u601d\u8003\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

However, a persistent challenge lies in linking such internal features to the reliable control of complex, behavior-level semantic attributes in language generation. In this paper, we propose a Sparse Autoencoder-based framework for retrieving and steering semantically interpretable internal features associated with high-level linguistic behaviors. Our method employs a contrastive feature retrieval pipeline based on controlled semantic oppositions, combing statistical activation analysis and generation-based validation to distill monosemantic functional features from sparse activation spaces. Using the Big Five personality traits as a case study, we demonstrate that our method enables precise, bidirectional steering of model behavior while maintaining superior stability and performance compared to existing activation steering methods like Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA). We further identify an empirical effect, which we term Functional Faithfulness, whereby intervening on a specific internal feature induces coherent and predictable shifts across multiple linguistic dimensions aligned with the target semantic attribute.

This issue arises from architectural limits of transformers, where counting is performed across layers, leading to degraded precision for larger counting problems due to depth constraints. To address this limitation, we propose a simple test-time strategy inspired by System-2 cognitive processes that decomposes large counting tasks into smaller, independent sub-problems that the model can reliably solve. We evaluate this approach using observational and causal mediation analyses to understand the underlying mechanism of this System-2-like strategy. Our mechanistic analysis identifies key components: latent counts are computed and stored in the final item representations of each part, transferred to intermediate steps via dedicated attention heads, and aggregated in the final stage to produce the total count. Experimental results demonstrate that this strategy enables LLMs to surpass architectural limitations and achieve high accuracy on large-scale counting tasks. This work provides mechanistic insight into System-2 counting in LLMs and presents a generalizable approach for improving and understanding their reasoning behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf2\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u8ba1\u6570\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u53ef\u9760\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u5c0f\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7fLLM\u7a81\u7834\u67b6\u6784\u9650\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8ba1\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8ba1\u6570\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9650\u5236\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u7531\u4e8etransformer\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u8ba1\u6570\u9700\u8981\u5728\u591a\u5c42\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u7ea6\u675f\u5bfc\u81f4\u8f83\u5927\u8ba1\u6570\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53d7\u7cfb\u7edf2\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u5c06\u5927\u8ba1\u6570\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u53ef\u9760\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u4e2d\u4ecb\u5206\u6790\u7406\u89e3\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5e95\u5c42\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u6f5c\u5728\u8ba1\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e76\u5b58\u50a8\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u9879\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u4f20\u9012\u5230\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6700\u540e\u9636\u6bb5\u805a\u5408\u4ea7\u751f\u603b\u8ba1\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u4f7fLLM\u80fd\u591f\u8d85\u8d8a\u67b6\u6784\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8ba1\u6570\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8ba1\u6570\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3aLLM\u4e2d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf2\u8ba1\u6570\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u673a\u5236\u6027\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3transformer\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u8ba1\u6570\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

We empirically show that under Top-5 retrieval with the gold document included, LLM answers vary substantially across permutations of the retrieved set, even when the gold document is fixed in the first position. This reveals a previously underexplored sensitivity to retrieval permutations. Although robust RAG methods primarily focus on enhancing LLM robustness to low-quality retrieval and mitigating positional bias to distribute attention fairly over long contexts, neither approach directly addresses permutation sensitivity. In this paper, we propose Stable-RAG, which exploits permutation sensitivity estimation to mitigate permutation-induced hallucinations. Stable-RAG runs the generator under multiple retrieval orders, clusters hidden states, and decodes from a cluster-center representation that captures the dominant reasoning pattern. It then uses these reasoning results to align hallucinated outputs toward the correct answer, encouraging the model to produce consistent and accurate predictions across document permutations. Experiments on three QA datasets show that Stable-RAG significantly improves answer accuracy, reasoning consistency and robust generalization across datasets, retrievers, and input lengths compared with baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Stable-RAG\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6587\u6863\u987a\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u805a\u7c7b\u6765\u7f13\u89e3RAG\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\u987a\u5e8f\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5305\u542b\u9ec4\u91d1\u6587\u6863\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u68c0\u7d22\u6587\u6863\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u6392\u5217\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7b54\u6848\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u9c81\u68d2RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u6ca1\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u79cd\u6392\u5217\u654f\u611f\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faStable-RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u68c0\u7d22\u987a\u5e8f\u4e0b\u8fd0\u884c\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff1b2\uff09\u5bf9\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u7c7b\uff1b3\uff09\u4ece\u6355\u83b7\u4e3b\u5bfc\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8868\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u7801\uff1b4\uff09\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63a8\u7406\u7ed3\u679c\u5c06\u5e7b\u89c9\u8f93\u51fa\u5bf9\u9f50\u5230\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u9f13\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6587\u6863\u6392\u5217\u4e0b\u4ea7\u751f\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2aQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cStable-RAG\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "Stable-RAG\u901a\u8fc7\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u6392\u5217\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86RAG\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u68c0\u7d22\u6587\u6863\u987a\u5e8f\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

However, recent work shows that LRMs often arrive at the correct answer before completing these textual reasoning steps, indicating the presence of latent reasoning -- internal, non-verbal computation encoded in hidden states. While this phenomenon has been explored in English, its multilingual behavior remains largely unknown. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation of multilingual latent reasoning in LRMs across 11 languages. Using a truncation-based strategy, we examine how the correct answer emerges as the model is given only partial reasoning traces, allowing us to measure stepwise latent prediction formation. Our results reveal clear evidence of multilingual latent reasoning, though unevenly: strong in resource-rich languages, weaker in low-resource ones, and broadly less observable on harder benchmarks. To understand whether these differences reflect distinct internal mechanisms, we further perform representational analyses. Despite surface-level disparities, we find that the internal evolution of predictions is highly consistent across languages and broadly aligns with English -- a pattern suggesting an English-centered latent reasoning pathway.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u95f4\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u5448\u73b0\u51fa\u4ee5\u82f1\u8bed\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5b83\u4eec\u7ecf\u5e38\u5728\u5b8c\u6210\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e4b\u524d\u5c31\u5f97\u51fa\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u5b58\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\uff08\u5185\u90e8\u975e\u8bed\u8a00\u8ba1\u7b97\uff09\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u82f1\u8bed\u4e2d\u88ab\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u5176\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u884c\u4e3a\u4ecd\u672a\u77e5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u622a\u65ad\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u572811\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u53ea\u7ed9\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u5206\u63a8\u7406\u75d5\u8ff9\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u5982\u4f55\u9010\u6b65\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6d4b\u91cf\u9010\u6b65\u6f5c\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u5f62\u6210\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u8868\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u660e\u786e\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\uff1a\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5f3a\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5f31\uff0c\u5728\u66f4\u96be\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u8f83\u5c11\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8868\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u6f14\u5316\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u95f4\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e0e\u82f1\u8bed\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u786e\u5b9e\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4f46\u5448\u73b0\u51fa\u4ee5\u82f1\u8bed\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u8fd9\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u65f6\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5236\u5dee\u5f02\u3002"}}

Existing chunk-based retrieval often provides irrelevant and logically incoherent context, leading to incomplete evidence chains and incorrect reasoning during answer generation. To address these challenges, we propose SentGraph, a sentence-level graph-based RAG framework that explicitly models fine-grained logical relationships between sentences for multi-hop question answering. Specifically, we construct a hierarchical sentence graph offline by first adapting Rhetorical Structure Theory to distinguish nucleus and satellite sentences, and then organizing them into topic-level subgraphs with cross-document entity bridges.

To address this, we propose MMFormalizer, which extends autoformalization beyond text by integrating adaptive grounding with entities from real-world mathematical and physical domains. MMFormalizer recursively constructs formal propositions from perceptually grounded primitives through recursive grounding and axiom composition, with adaptive recursive termination ensuring that every abstraction is supported by visual evidence and anchored in dimensional or axiomatic grounding. We evaluate MMFormalizer on a new benchmark, PhyX-AF, comprising 115 curated samples from MathVerse, PhyX, Synthetic Geometry, and Analytic Geometry, covering diverse multimodal autoformalization tasks. Results show that frontier models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-3-Pro achieve the highest compile and semantic accuracy, with GPT-5 excelling in physical reasoning, while geometry remains the most challenging domain. Overall, MMFormalizer provides a scalable framework for unified multimodal autoformalization, bridging perception and formal reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multimodal autoformalization method capable of handling classical mechanics (derived from the Hamiltonian), as well as relativity, quantum mechanics, and thermodynamics.

Standard supervised training lacks explicit annotations for symptom evolution, while direct Reinforcement Learning (RL) is hindered by sparse binary rewards. To address this challenge, we introduce Dementia-R1, an RL-based framework for longitudinal dementia prognosis from unstructured clinical notes. Our approach adopts a Cold-Start RL strategy that pre-trains the model to predict verifiable clinical indices extracted from patient histories, enhancing the capability to reason about disease progression before determining the final clinical status. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Dementia-R1 achieves an F1 score of 77.03% on real-world unstructured clinical datasets.

However, existing benchmarks and evaluation frameworks for assessing the information-gathering and diagnostic reasoning abilities of medical large language models (LLMs) have not been rigorously evaluated. To address these gaps, we present MedDialogRubrics, a novel benchmark comprising 5,200 synthetically constructed patient cases and over 60,000 fine-grained evaluation rubrics generated by LLMs and subsequently refined by clinical experts, specifically designed to assess the multi-turn diagnostic capabilities of LLM. Our framework employs a multi-agent system to synthesize realistic patient records and chief complaints from underlying disease knowledge without accessing real-world electronic health records, thereby mitigating privacy and data-governance concerns. We design a robust Patient Agent that is limited to a set of atomic medical facts and augmented with a dynamic guidance mechanism that continuously detects and corrects hallucinations throughout the dialogue, ensuring internal coherence and clinical plausibility of the simulated cases.

We address the scarcity of long-context QA resources for Indic languages by introducing LittiChoQA, the largest literary QA dataset to date covering many languages spoken in the Gangetic plains of India. The dataset comprises over 270K automatically generated question-answer pairs with a balanced distribution of factoid and non-factoid questions, generated from naturally authored literary texts collected from the open web. We evaluate multiple multilingual LLMs on non-factoid, abstractive QA, under both full-context and context-shortened settings. Results demonstrate a clear trade-off between performance and efficiency: full-context fine-tuning yields the highest token-level and semantic-level scores, while context shortening substantially improves throughput. Among the evaluated models, Krutrim-2 achieves the strongest performance, obtaining a semantic score of 76.1 with full context. While, in shortened context settings it scores 74.9 with answer paragraph selection and 71.4 with vector-based retrieval.

We introduce F-DPO (Factuality-aware Direct Preference Optimization), a simple extension of DPO that uses only binary factuality labels. F-DPO (i) applies a label-flipping transformation that corrects misordered preference pairs so the chosen response is never less factual than the rejected one, and (ii) adds a factuality-aware margin that emphasizes pairs with clear correctness differences, while reducing to standard DPO when both responses share the same factuality. We construct factuality-aware preference data by augmenting DPO pairs with binary factuality indicators and synthetic hallucinated variants. Across seven open-weight LLMs (1B-14B), F-DPO consistently improves factuality and reduces hallucination rates relative to both base models and standard DPO. On Qwen3-8B, F-DPO reduces hallucination rates by five times (from 0.424 to 0.084) while improving factuality scores by 50 percent (from 5.26 to 7.90). F-DPO also generalizes to out-of-distribution benchmarks: on TruthfulQA, Qwen2.5-14B achieves plus 17 percent MC1 accuracy (0.500 to 0.585) and plus 49 percent MC2 accuracy (0.357 to 0.531).

To address this gap, the NorLLM team at NorwAI has developed a family of models specifically tailored to Norwegian and other Scandinavian languages, building on diverse Transformer-based architectures such as GPT, Mistral, Llama2, Mixtral and Magistral. These models are either pretrained from scratch or continually pretrained on 25B - 88.45B tokens, using a Norwegian-extended tokenizer and advanced post-training strategies to optimize performance, enhance robustness, and improve adaptability across various real-world tasks.

In contrast, we observe that their corresponding base LLMs often remain well-calibrated. This naturally motivates us to calibrate PoLLM confidence using the base LLM as a reference. This work proposes two ways to achieve this. A straightforward solution, BaseCal-ReEval, evaluates PoLLM's responses by feeding them into the base LLM to get average probabilities as confidence. While effective, this approach introduces additional inference overhead. To address this, we propose BaseCal-Proj, which trains a lightweight projection to map the final-layer hidden states of PoLLMs back to those of their base LLMs. These projected states are then processed by the base LLM's output layer to derive base-calibrated confidence for PoLLM's responses. Notably, BaseCal is an unsupervised, plug-and-play solution that operates without human labels or LLM modifications.

Prior work typically decomposes inference into prefill and decode stages, with the decode stage dominating total latency. To reduce time and memory complexity in the decode stage, a line of work introduces sparse-attention algorithms. In this paper, we show, both empirically and theoretically, that sparse attention can paradoxically increase end-to-end complexity: information loss often induces significantly longer sequences, a phenomenon we term ``Less is Less'' (Lil). To mitigate the Lil problem, we propose an early-stopping algorithm that detects the threshold where information loss exceeds information gain during sparse decoding.

By representing the entire conversation as a temporal graph, we present a novel graph-based method for detecting dialogue-level hallucinations. Our framework models each dialogue as a node, encoding it using a sentence transformer. We explore two different ways of connectivity: i) shared-entity edges, which connect turns that refer to the same entities; ii) temporal edges, which connect contiguous turns in the conversation. Message-passing is used to update the node embeddings, allowing flow of information between related nodes. The context-aware node embeddings are then combined using attention pooling into a single vector, which is then passed on to a classifier to determine the presence and type of hallucinations. We demonstrate that our method offers slightly improved performance over existing methods. Further, we show the attention mechanism can be used to justify the decision making process.

It can effectively reduce factuality hallucinations, but faithfulness hallucinations still exist. Previous methods for detecting faithfulness hallucinations either neglect to capture the models' internal reasoning processes or handle those features coarsely, making it difficult for discriminators to learn. This paper proposes a semantic-level internal reasoning graph-based method for detecting faithfulness hallucination. Specifically, we first extend the layer-wise relevance propagation algorithm from the token level to the semantic level, constructing an internal reasoning graph based on attribution vectors. This provides a more faithful semantic-level representation of dependency. Furthermore, we design a general framework based on a small pre-trained language model to utilize the dependencies in LLM's reasoning for training and hallucination detection, which can dynamically adjust the pass rate of correct samples through a threshold.

We address this gap diagnostically and propose greedy pruning, a likelihood-preserving deletion procedure that iteratively removes reasoning tokens whose removal minimally degrades model likelihood under a specified objective, yielding length-controlled reasoning chains. We evaluate pruned reasoning in a distillation framework and show that students trained on pruned chains outperform a frontier-model-supervised compression baseline at matched reasoning lengths.

Although many approaches seek to align large language models (LLMs) with human moral values, how to enable them morally sensitive has been extremely challenging. In this paper, we take a step toward answering the question: how can we enhance moral sensitivity in LLMs? Specifically, we propose two pragmatic inference methods that faciliate LLMs to diagnose morally benign and hazardous input and correct moral errors, whereby enhancing LLMs' moral sensitivity. A central strength of our pragmatic inference methods is their unified perspective: instead of modeling moral discourses across semantically diverse and complex surface forms, they offer a principled perspective for designing pragmatic inference procedures grounded in their inferential loads. Empirical evidence demonstrates that our pragmatic methods can enhance moral sensitivity in LLMs and achieves strong performance on representative morality-relevant benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u8bed\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u589e\u5f3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u8bca\u65ad\u9053\u5fb7\u826f\u6027\u4e0e\u5371\u9669\u8f93\u5165\u5e76\u7ea0\u6b63\u9053\u5fb7\u9519\u8bef", "motivation": "\u9053\u5fb7\u654f\u611f\u6027\u662f\u4eba\u7c7b\u9053\u5fb7\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u4f7f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u9053\u5fb7\u654f\u611f\u6027\u6781\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u56de\u7b54\u5982\u4f55\u589e\u5f3aLLMs\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u654f\u611f\u6027\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u8bed\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u8bca\u65ad\u9053\u5fb7\u826f\u6027\u4e0e\u5371\u9669\u8f93\u5165\uff1b2\uff09\u7ea0\u6b63\u9053\u5fb7\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bed\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4ece\u63a8\u7406\u8d1f\u8f7d\u89d2\u5ea6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u6837\u7684\u8868\u5c42\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0a\u5efa\u6a21\u9053\u5fb7\u8bdd\u8bed\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8bed\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3aLLMs\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u76f8\u5173\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5f3a\u52b2\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bed\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u89c6\u89d2\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u9053\u5fb7\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002"}}

Input attribution methods aim to highlight each input token's contributions to the model's output, but existing approaches are typically model-agnostic, and do not focus on transformer-specific architectures, leading to limited faithfulness. To address this, we propose Grad-ELLM, a gradient-based attribution method for decoder-only transformer-based LLMs. By aggregating channel importance from gradients of the output logit with respect to attention layers and spatial importance from attention maps, Grad-ELLM generates heatmaps at each generation step without requiring architectural modifications. Additionally, we introduce two faithfulneses metrics $\u03c0$-Soft-NC and $\u03c0$-Soft-NS, which are modifications of Soft-NC/NS that provide fairer comparisons by controlling the amount of information kept when perturbing the text. We evaluate Grad-ELLM on sentiment classification, question answering, and open-generation tasks using different models. Experiment results show that Grad-ELLM consistently achieves superior faithfulness than other attribution methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Grad-ELLM\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u4ec5\u89e3\u7801\u5668Transformer\u7684LLM\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u68af\u5ea6\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u70ed\u529b\u56fe\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u9ed1\u76d2\u6027\u8d28\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5bf9\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\uff0c\u672a\u9488\u5bf9Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGrad-ELLM\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u68af\u5ea6\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u4ece\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u68af\u5ea6\u805a\u5408\u901a\u9053\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u4ece\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u805a\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff1b3\uff09\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u751f\u6210\u6b65\u9aa4\u751f\u6210\u70ed\u529b\u56fe\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u67b6\u6784\u4fee\u6539\u3002\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u03c0-Soft-NC\u548c\u03c0-Soft-NS\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86Soft-NC/NS\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u6270\u52a8\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u95ee\u7b54\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aGrad-ELLM\u5728\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Grad-ELLM\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u4ec5\u89e3\u7801\u5668Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86LLM\u8f93\u5165\u5f52\u56e0\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u03c0-Soft-NC/NS\u5ea6\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

We present the first neuron-level interpretability study of emotion-sensitive neurons (ESNs) in LALMs and provide causal evidence that such units exist in Qwen2.5-Omni, Kimi-Audio, and Audio Flamingo 3. Across these three widely used open-source models, we compare frequency-, entropy-, magnitude-, and contrast-based neuron selectors on multiple emotion recognition benchmarks. Using inference-time interventions, we reveal a consistent emotion-specific signature: ablating neurons selected for a given emotion disproportionately degrades recognition of that emotion while largely preserving other classes, whereas gain-based amplification steers predictions toward the target emotion.

We propose ToxiGAN, a class-aware text augmentation framework that combines adversarial generation with semantic guidance from large language models (LLMs). To address common issues in GAN-based augmentation such as mode collapse and semantic drift, ToxiGAN introduces a two-step directional training strategy and leverages LLM-generated neutral texts as semantic ballast. Unlike prior work that treats LLMs as static generators, our approach dynamically selects neutral exemplars to provide balanced guidance. Toxic samples are explicitly optimized to diverge from these exemplars, reinforcing class-specific contrastive signals. Experiments on four hate speech benchmarks show that ToxiGAN achieves the strongest average performance in both macro-F1 and hate-F1, consistently outperforming traditional and LLM-based augmentation methods. Ablation and sensitivity analyses further confirm the benefits of semantic ballast and directional training in enhancing classifier robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "ToxiGAN\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6297\u751f\u6210\u548cLLM\u8bed\u4e49\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u611f\u77e5\u6587\u672c\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u6b65\u5b9a\u5411\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u538b\u8231\u7269\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3GAN\u589e\u5f3a\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u548cLLM\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6bd2\u6027\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u9762\u4e34\u76d1\u7763\u6709\u9650\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u659c\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709GAN\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800cLLM\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5c06LLM\u89c6\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u52a8\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "ToxiGAN\u91c7\u7528\u7c7b\u522b\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u6297\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u6b65\u5b9a\u5411\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u6027\u6587\u672c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u538b\u8231\u7269\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u6027\u8303\u4f8b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e73\u8861\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u4f7f\u6bd2\u6027\u6837\u672c\u660e\u786e\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u504f\u79bb\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8303\u4f8b\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u7c7b\u522b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cToxiGAN\u5728macro-F1\u548chate-F1\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u548c\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u538b\u8231\u7269\u548c\u5b9a\u5411\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u589e\u5f3a\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u76ca\u5904\u3002", "conclusion": "ToxiGAN\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6297\u751f\u6210\u548c\u52a8\u6001LLM\u8bed\u4e49\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6bd2\u6027\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6587\u672c\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6bd2\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Experiments on Guarani--Spanish and Quechua--Spanish translation show consistent chrF++ improvements from synthetic data augmentation, while diagnostic experiments on Aymara highlight the limitations of generic preprocessing for highly agglutinative languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5e73\u884c\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u7684\u571f\u8457\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u5347\u795e\u7ecf\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u9488\u5bf9\u7f8e\u6d32\u7684\u571f\u8457\u8bed\u8a00\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u571f\u8457\u8bed\u8a00\u901a\u5e38\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u5e73\u884c\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u6765\u652f\u6301\u6709\u6548\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u4e3a\u7f13\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u5bb9\u91cf\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u53e5\u5b50\u5bf9\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u7f8e\u6d32\u571f\u8457\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5e73\u884c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u5bf9\u591a\u8bed\u8a00mBART\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u7cbe\u9009\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6b63\u5b57\u6cd5\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u611f\u77e5\u8fc7\u6ee4\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u74dc\u62c9\u5c3c\u8bed-\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u8bed\u548c\u514b\u4e18\u4e9a\u8bed-\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u8bed\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u5e26\u6765\u4e86chrF++\u6307\u6807\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u800c\u5728\u827e\u9a6c\u62c9\u8bed\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u5219\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u9884\u5904\u7406\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9ad8\u5ea6\u9ecf\u7740\u6027\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u571f\u8457\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u6027\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9ad8\u5ea6\u9ecf\u7740\u6027\u8bed\u8a00\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5e73\u884c\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u7684\u571f\u8457\u8bed\u8a00\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The Japanese bar examination is a particularly demanding benchmark, requiring not only advanced legal reasoning but also strict adherence to complex answer formats that involve joint evaluation of multiple propositions. While recent studies have reported improvements by decomposing such questions into simpler true--false judgments, these approaches have not been systematically evaluated under the original exam format and scoring scheme, leaving open the question of whether they truly capture exam-level competence. In this paper, we present a self-verification model trained on a newly constructed dataset that faithfully replicates the authentic format and evaluation scale of the exam. Our model is able to exceed the official passing score when evaluated on the actual exam scale, marking the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of an LLM passing the Japanese bar examination without altering its original question structure or scoring rules. We further conduct extensive comparisons with alternative strategies, including multi-agent inference and decomposition-based supervision, and find that these methods fail to achieve comparable performance. Our results highlight the importance of format-faithful supervision and consistency verification, and suggest that carefully designed single-model approaches can outperform more complex systems in high-stakes professional reasoning tasks.

Step-wise analysis further shows that while CoT's influence on accuracy grows monotonically during the reasoning process, distributional structure is largely determined by LLM's intrinsic priors. These findings suggest that long CoT serves as a decisive LLM decision-maker for the top option but fails to function as a granular distribution calibrator for ambiguous tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u957f\u94fe\u601d\u7ef4\u63a8\u7406\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5355\u7b54\u6848\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9700\u8981\u6355\u6349\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u800c\u975e\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u7b7e\u53d8\u5f02\u5efa\u6a21\uff09\u4e2d\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\"\u89e3\u8026\u673a\u5236\"\uff1a\u63a8\u7406\u6587\u672c\u51b3\u5b9a\u6700\u7ec8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u6a21\u578b\u5148\u9a8c\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5206\u5e03\u6392\u5e8f\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u63a8\u7406\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5355\u7b54\u6848\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u80fd\u5426\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u7b7e\u53d8\u5f02\uff08\u5373\u6355\u6349\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u800c\u975e\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\uff09\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u8026\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u8026\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Cross-CoT\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6765\u5206\u79bb\u63a8\u7406\u6587\u672c\u548c\u5185\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u8fdb\u884c\u9010\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u6765\u8ffd\u8e2a\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u660e\u663e\u7684\"\u89e3\u8026\u673a\u5236\"\uff1a\u867d\u7136CoT\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f46\u6700\u7ec8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7531CoT\u5185\u5bb9\u51b3\u5b9a\uff08\u8d21\u732e99%\u65b9\u5dee\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u5206\u5e03\u6392\u5e8f\u7531\u6a21\u578b\u5148\u9a8c\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff08\u8d85\u8fc780%\uff09\u3002\u9010\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0cCoT\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5355\u8c03\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4f46\u5206\u5e03\u7ed3\u6784\u4e3b\u8981\u7531LLM\u7684\u5185\u5728\u5148\u9a8c\u51b3\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u957f\u94fe\u601d\u7ef4\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u5b9a\u6700\u4f73\u9009\u9879\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u65e0\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u6821\u51c6\u5668\u3002\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5f53\u524d\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6355\u6349\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u3002"}}

However, planning remains a bottleneck, as existing methods struggle with long-horizon strategies. Our analysis reveals a critical phenomenon, plan anchor, where the first reasoning step disproportionately impacts downstream behavior in long-horizon web reasoning tasks. Current RL algorithms, fail to account for this by uniformly distributing rewards across the trajectory. To address this, we propose Anchor-GRPO, a two-stage RL framework that decouples planning and execution. In Stage 1, the agent optimizes its first-step planning using fine-grained rubrics derived from self-play experiences and human calibration. In Stage 2, execution is aligned with the initial plan through sparse rewards, ensuring stable and efficient tool usage. We evaluate Anchor-GRPO on four benchmarks: BrowseComp, BrowseComp-Zh, GAIA, and XBench-DeepSearch. Across models from 3B to 30B, Anchor-GRPO outperforms baseline GRPO and First-step GRPO, improving task success and tool efficiency. Notably, WebAnchor-30B achieves 46.0% pass@1 on BrowseComp and 76.4% on GAIA.

However, existing approaches typically treat all tokens in a response indiscriminately and enforce uncertainty over the entire vocabulary. This global treatment results in unnecessary utility degradation and extends optimization to content-agnostic regions. To address these limitations, we propose PALU (Prefix-Aware Localized Unlearning), a framework driven by a local entropy maximization objective across both temporal and vocabulary dimensions. PALU reveals that (i) suppressing the sensitive prefix alone is sufficient to sever the causal generation link, and (ii) flattening only the top-$k$ logits is adequate to maximize uncertainty in the critical subspace. These findings allow PALU to avoid redundant optimization across the full vocabulary and parameter space while minimizing collateral damage to general model performance.

While Large Language Models possess strong reasoning capabilities, they struggle to emulate this self-evolution: fine-tuning is computationally expensive and prone to catastrophic forgetting, while existing memory-based methods rely on passive semantic matching that often retrieves noise. To address these challenges, we propose MemRL, a framework that enables agents to self-evolve via non-parametric reinforcement learning on episodic memory. MemRL explicitly separates the stable reasoning of a frozen LLM from the plastic, evolving memory. Unlike traditional methods, MemRL employs a Two-Phase Retrieval mechanism that filters candidates by semantic relevance and then selects them based on learned Q-values (utility). These utilities are continuously refined via environmental feedback in an trial-and-error manner, allowing the agent to distinguish high-value strategies from similar noise. Extensive experiments on HLE, BigCodeBench, ALFWorld, and Lifelong Agent Bench demonstrate that MemRL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

We propose a novel explainability-guided training framework, X-MuTeST (eXplainable Multilingual haTe Speech deTection), for hate speech detection that combines high-level semantic reasoning from large language models (LLMs) with traditional attention-enhancing techniques. We extend this research to Hindi and Telugu alongside English by providing benchmark human-annotated rationales for each word to justify the assigned class label. The X-MuTeST explainability method computes the difference between the prediction probabilities of the original text and those of unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams. Final explanations are computed as the union between LLM explanations and X-MuTeST explanations. We show that leveraging human rationales during training enhances both classification performance and explainability. Moreover, combining human rationales with our explainability method to refine the model attention yields further improvements. We evaluate explainability using Plausibility metrics such as Token-F1 and IOU-F1 and Faithfulness metrics such as Comprehensiveness and Sufficiency. By focusing on under-resourced languages, our work advances hate speech detection across diverse linguistic contexts.

Results show DIP maintains generation quality while achieving up to 12.9$\\times$ inference speedup over standard inference and 1.17$\\times$ over KV cache-enhanced inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDIP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u63d2\u5165\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u793a\u4f8b\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe12.9\u500d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u5176\u53cc\u5411\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u4f1a\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u8303\u5f0f\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u89c4\u5212\u5668(DIP)\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u662f\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u6240\u6709\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u63d2\u5165\u76f8\u5173\u793a\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "DIP\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe12.9\u500d\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca1.17\u500d\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8303\u5f0f\u5141\u8bb8\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8c03\u6574\uff0cDIP\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u793a\u4f8b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Although Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has succeeded in specific domains , the field lacks large-scale, high-quality, and difficulty-calibrated data for general reasoning. To address this, we propose UltraLogic, a framework that decouples the logical core of a problem from its natural language expression through a Code-based Solving methodology to automate high-quality data production. The framework comprises hundreds of unique task types and an automated calibration pipeline across ten difficulty levels. Furthermore, to mitigate binary reward sparsity and the Non-negative Reward Trap, we introduce the Bipolar Float Reward (BFR) mechanism, utilizing graded penalties to effectively distinguish perfect responses from those with logical flaws. Our experiments demonstrate that task diversity is the primary driver for reasoning enhancement , and that BFR, combined with a difficulty matching strategy, significantly improves training efficiency, guiding models toward global logical optima.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faUltraLogic\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u7801\u5316\u6c42\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u903b\u8f91\u6838\u5fc3\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u96be\u5ea6\u5206\u7ea7\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u6781\u6d6e\u70b9\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6b65\u903b\u8f91\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u590d\u6742\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u96be\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUltraLogic\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u4ee3\u7801\u5316\u6c42\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u903b\u8f91\u6838\u5fc3\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u89e3\u8026\uff1b2\uff09\u5305\u542b\u6570\u767e\u79cd\u72ec\u7279\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u8de8\u5341\u4e2a\u96be\u5ea6\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6821\u51c6\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1b3\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u6781\u6d6e\u70b9\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u7ea7\u60e9\u7f5a\u533a\u5206\u5b8c\u7f8e\u54cd\u5e94\u4e0e\u5b58\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u4efb\u52a1\u591a\u6837\u6027\u662f\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u9a71\u52a8\u529b\uff1b\u53cc\u6781\u6d6e\u70b9\u5956\u52b1\u7ed3\u5408\u96be\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u5230\u5168\u5c40\u903b\u8f91\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "UltraLogic\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u96be\u5ea6\u5206\u7ea7\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We formalize a core student-modeling problem as Malrule Reasoning Accuracy (MRA): infer a misconception from one worked mistake and predict the student's next answer under cross-template rephrasing. Across nine language models (4B-120B), accuracy drops from 66% on direct problem solving to 40% on cross-template misconception prediction. MalruleLib encodes 101 malrules over 498 parameterized problem templates and produces paired dual-path traces for both correct reasoning and malrule-consistent student reasoning. Because malrules are executable and templates are parameterizable, MalruleLib can generate over one million instances, enabling scalable supervision and controlled evaluation. Using MalruleLib, we observe cross-template degradations of 10-21%, while providing student step traces improves prediction by 3-15%.

Purpose: To create RXL-RADSet, a radiologist-verified synthetic multi-RADS benchmark, and compare validity and accuracy of open-weight small language models (SLMs) with a proprietary model for RADS assignment. Materials and Methods: RXL-RADSet contains 1,600 synthetic radiology reports across 10 RADS (BI-RADS, CAD-RADS, GB-RADS, LI-RADS, Lung-RADS, NI-RADS, O-RADS, PI-RADS, TI-RADS, VI-RADS) and multiple modalities. Reports were generated by LLMs using scenario plans and simulated radiologist styles and underwent two-stage radiologist verification. We evaluated 41 quantized SLMs (12 families, 0.135-32B parameters) and GPT-5.2 under a fixed guided prompt. Primary endpoints were validity and accuracy; a secondary analysis compared guided versus zero-shot prompting. Results: Under guided prompting GPT-5.2 achieved 99.8% validity and 81.1% accuracy (1,600 predictions). Pooled SLMs (65,600 predictions) achieved 96.8% validity and 61.1% accuracy; top SLMs in the 20-32B range reached ~99% validity and mid-to-high 70% accuracy. Performance scaled with model size (inflection between <1B and >=10B) and declined with RADS complexity primarily due to classification difficulty rather than invalid outputs. Guided prompting improved validity (99.2% vs 96.7%) and accuracy (78.5% vs 69.6%) compared with zero-shot.

This capability is vital for high-stakes decision-making in systems such as traffic networks, power grids, and disease propagation. However, the field remains underdeveloped because most existing works prioritize predictive accuracy over reasoning. To address the gap, we introduce ST-Bench, a benchmark consisting of four core tasks, including etiological reasoning, entity identification, correlation reasoning, and in-context forecasting, developed via a network SDE-based multi-agent data synthesis pipeline. We then propose STReasoner, which empowers LLM to integrate time series, graph structure, and text for explicit reasoning. To promote spatially grounded logic, we introduce S-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that rewards performance gains specifically attributable to spatial information. Experiments show that STReasoner achieves average accuracy gains between 17% and 135% at only 0.004X the cost of proprietary models and generalizes robustly to real-world data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faST-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548cSTReasoner\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65f6\u7a7a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u672c\u4ec50.004\u500d\u4f46\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5173\u6ce8\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65f6\u7a7a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u7406\u5bf9\u4ea4\u901a\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u7535\u7f51\u3001\u75be\u75c5\u4f20\u64ad\u7b49\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u53d1\u5c55\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "1) \u63d0\u51faST-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b2) \u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u7edcSDE\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\uff1b3) \u63d0\u51faSTReasoner\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7fLLM\u80fd\u591f\u6574\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u3001\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6587\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff1b4) \u5f15\u5165S-GRPO\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u5956\u52b1\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "result": "STReasoner\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u534717%-135%\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u4ec5\u4e3a\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u76840.004\u500d\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7ST-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u548cSTReasoner\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u65f6\u7a7a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u7406\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}
