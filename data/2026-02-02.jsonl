This paper investigates drunk language, i.e., text written under the influence of alcohol, as a driver for safety failures in large language models (LLMs). We investigate three mechanisms for inducing drunk language in LLMs: persona-based prompting, causal fine-tuning, and reinforcement-based post-training. When evaluated on 5 LLMs, we observe a higher susceptibility to jailbreaking on JailbreakBench (even in the presence of defences) and privacy leaks on ConfAIde, where both benchmarks are in English, as compared to the base LLMs as well as previously reported approaches. Via a robust combination of manual evaluation and LLM-based evaluators and analysis of error categories, our findings highlight a correspondence between human-intoxicated behaviour, and anthropomorphism in LLMs induced with drunk language. The simplicity and efficiency of our drunk language inducement approaches position them as potential counters for LLM safety tuning, highlighting significant risks to LLM safety."}

Based on this theory, we introduce two training-free extensions, MrRoPE-Uni and MrRoPE-Pro, which leverage uniform and progressive radix conversion strategies, respectively, to achieve 'train short, test long' generalization. Without fine-tuning, MrRoPE-Pro sustains over 85% recall in the 128K-context Needle-in-a-Haystack test and achieves more than double YaRN's accuracy on Infinite-Bench retrieval and dialogue subsets.

At test time, collaborative reasoning through Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as a promising approach for enhancing LLM performance. However, current RLVR methods typically train LLMs to solve problems in isolation, without explicitly preparing them to synthesize and benefit from different rationales that arise during debate. In this work, we propose Self-Debate Reinforcement Learning (SDRL), a training framework that equips a single LLM with strong standalone problem-solving ability and the capability to learn from diverse reasoning trajectories in MAD. Given a prompt, SDRL first samples multiple candidate solutions, then constructs a debate context with diverse reasoning paths and generates second-turn responses conditioned on this context. Finally, SDRL jointly optimizes both the initial and debate-conditioned responses, yielding a model that is effective as both a standalone solver and a debate participant. Experiments across multiple base models and reasoning benchmarks show that SDRL improves overall MAD performance while simultaneously strengthening single model reasoning."}

Large language models (LLMs) have recently enabled substantial progress in automated veracity assessment, including automated fact-checking and claim verification systems. Typical veracity assessment pipelines break down complex claims into sub-claims, retrieve external evidence, and then apply LLM reasoning to assess veracity. However, existing methods often treat evidence retrieval as a static, isolated step and do not effectively manage or reuse retrieved evidence across claims. In this work, we propose MERMAID, a memory-enhanced multi-agent veracity assessment framework that tightly couples the retrieval and reasoning processes. MERMAID integrates agent-driven search, structured knowledge representations, and a persistent memory module within a Reason-Action style iterative process, enabling dynamic evidence acquisition and cross-claim evidence reuse. By retaining retrieved evidence in an evidence memory, the framework reduces redundant searches and improves verification efficiency and consistency. We evaluate MERMAID on three fact-checking benchmarks and two claim-verification datasets using multiple LLMs, including GPT, LLaMA, and Qwen families. Experimental results show that MERMAID achieves state-of-the-art performance while improving the search efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness of synergizing retrieval, reasoning, and memory for reliable veracity assessment."}

Building on this foundation, we propose FITMM, a Frequency-aware Information-Theoretic framework for multimodal recommendation. FITMM constructs graph-enhanced item representations, performs modality-wise spectral decomposition to obtain orthogonal bands, and forms lightweight within-band multimodal components. A residual, task-adaptive gate aggregates bands into the final representation. To control redundancy and improve generalization, we regularize training with a frequency-domain IB term that allocates capacity across bands (Wiener-like shrinkage with shut-off of weak bands). We further introduce a cross-modal spectral consistency loss that aligns modalities within each band. The model is jointly optimized with the standard recommendation loss. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that FITMM consistently and significantly outperforms advanced baselines."}

Language models can also adapt to diverse tasks and learn new structure in context, and recent work has shown that this in-context learning (ICL) can be reflected in representational changes. Here we bring these two lines of research together to explore whether representation straightening occurs \\emph{within} a context during ICL. We measure representational straightening in Gemma 2 models across a diverse set of in-context tasks, and uncover a dichotomy in how LLMs' representations change in context. In continual prediction settings (e.g., natural language, grid world traversal tasks) we observe that increasing context increases the straightness of neural sequence trajectories, which is correlated with improvement in model prediction. Conversely, in structured prediction settings (e.g., few-shot tasks), straightening is inconsistent -- it is only present in phases of the task with explicit structure (e.g., repeating a template), but vanishes elsewhere. These results suggest that ICL is not a monolithic process. Instead, we propose that LLMs function like a Swiss Army knife: depending on task structure, the LLM dynamically selects between strategies, only some of which yield representational straightening."}

With large language models (LLMs) on the cloud, semantic user representations can improve sequential recommendation by capturing high-level intent. However, regenerating such representations via cloud LLM inference for every request is often infeasible at real-world scale. As a result, on-device reranking commonly reuses a cached cloud semantic user embedding across requests. We empirically identify a cloud semantic staleness effect: reused embeddings become less aligned with the user's latest interactions, leading to measurable ranking degradation.\n  Most existing LLM-enabled cloud-device recommenders are typically designed around on-demand cloud semantics, either by assuming low-latency cloud LLM access or by regenerating semantic embeddings per request. When per-request regeneration is infeasible and cached semantics must be reused, two technical challenges arise: (1) deciding when cached cloud semantics remain useful for on-device reranking, and (2) maintaining ranking quality when the cloud LLM cannot be invoked and only cached semantics are available. To address this gap, we introduce the Semantic Calibration for LLM-enabled Cloud-Device Recommendation (SCaLRec). First, it estimates the reliability of cached semantics under the user's latest interactions. Second, an on-device semantic calibration module is proposed to adjusts the cached semantic embedding on-device using up-to-date interaction evidence, without per-request cloud LLM involvement. Experiments on real-world datasets show that SCaLRec consistently improves recommendation performance over strong baselines under cloud semantic staleness."}

We find that higher accuracy does not guarantee prompt stability, and that models can appear well-calibrated yet remain fragile to paraphrases. We propose a dual-objective prompt optimization loop that jointly targets accuracy and stability, showing that explicitly including a stability term reduces flip rates across tasks and models, sometimes at modest accuracy cost. Our results suggest prompt sensitivity should be an explicit objective when validating clinical LLM systems."}

PersonaAct synthesizes interpretable personas through automated interviews combining behavioral analysis with structured questioning, then trains agents on multimodal observations using supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. We deploy trained agents for filter bubble auditing and evaluate bubble breadth via content diversity and bubble depth via escape potential. The evaluation demonstrates substantial improvements in fidelity over generic LLM baselines, enabling realistic behavior reproduction. Results reveal significant content narrowing over interaction.

Instead of discarding the remaining \"long tail,\" SPLA compresses unselected blocks into a compact recurrent state via a residual linear attention (RLA) module. Crucially, to avoid IO overhead, we derive an optimized subtraction-based formulation for RLA -- calculating the residual as the difference between global and selected linear attention -- ensuring that unselected blocks are never explicitly accessed during inference.

This instability impedes effective learning of neural network parameters and limits the scalability of ranking models. In this paper, we show that semantic tokens possess greater scaling potential compared to item IDs. Our proposed framework TRM improves the token generation and application pipeline, leading to 33% reduction in sparse storage while achieving 0.85% AUC increase.

In this work, we introduce compact hypercube embeddings for fast text-based wildlife observation retrieval, a framework that enables efficient text-based search over large-scale wildlife image and audio databases using compact binary representations. Building on the cross-view code alignment hashing framework, we extend lightweight hashing beyond a single-modality setup to align natural language descriptions with visual or acoustic observations in a shared Hamming space. Our approach leverages pretrained wildlife foundation models, including BioCLIP and BioLingual, and adapts them efficiently for hashing using parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We evaluate our method on large-scale benchmarks, including iNaturalist2024 for text-to-image retrieval and iNatSounds2024 for text-to-audio retrieval, as well as multiple soundscape datasets to assess robustness under domain shift. Results show that retrieval using discrete hypercube embeddings achieves competitive, and in several cases superior, performance compared to continuous embeddings, while drastically reducing memory and search cost. Moreover, we observe that the hashing objective consistently improves the underlying encoder representations, leading to stronger retrieval and zero-shot generalization. These results demonstrate that binary, language-based retrieval enables scalable and efficient search over large wildlife archives for biodiversity monitoring systems."}

We test both architectures in zero-shot and few-shot conditions using GPT-5.1. Results show that the multi-agent system is significantly better at identifying weak essays while the single-agent system performs better on mid-range essays.

These methods typically employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to adapt LLMs to recommendation scenarios, and utilize beam search during inference to efficiently retrieve $B$ top-ranked recommended items. However, we identify a critical training-inference inconsistency: while SFT optimizes the overall probability of positive items, it does not guarantee that such items will be retrieved by beam search even if they possess high overall probabilities. Due to the greedy pruning mechanism, beam search can prematurely discard a positive item once its prefix probability is insufficient.\n  To address this inconsistency, we propose BEAR (Beam-SEarch-Aware Regularization), a novel fine-tuning objective that explicitly accounts for beam search behavior during training. Rather than directly simulating beam search for each instance during training, which is computationally prohibitive, BEAR enforces a relaxed necessary condition: each token in a positive item must rank within the top-$B$ candidate tokens at each decoding step. This objective effectively mitigates the risk of incorrect pruning while incurring negligible computational overhead compared to standard SFT. Extensive experiments across four real-world datasets demonstrate that BEAR significantly outperforms strong baselines. Code will be released upon acceptance."}

Current retrieval systems either ignore these constraints in neural embeddings or approximate them in a generative reasoning process that can be inconsistent and unreliable. Although well-suited to structured reasoning, existing neuro-symbolic approaches remain confined to formal logic or mathematics problems as they often assume unambiguous queries and access to complete evidence, conditions rarely met in information retrieval. To bridge this gap, we introduce OrLog, a neuro-symbolic retrieval framework that decouples predicate-level plausibility estimation from logical reasoning: a large language model (LLM) provides plausibility scores for atomic predicates in one decoding-free forward pass, from which a probabilistic reasoning engine derives the posterior probability of query satisfaction. We evaluate OrLog across multiple backbone LLMs, varying levels of access to external knowledge, and a range of logical constraints, and compare it against base retrievers and LLM-as-reasoner methods. Provided with entity descriptions, OrLog can significantly boost top-rank precision compared to LLM reasoning with larger gains on disjunctive queries. OrLog is also more efficient, cutting mean tokens by $\\sim$90\\% per query-entity pair. These results demonstrate that generation-free predicate plausibility estimation combined with probabilistic reasoning enables constraint-aware retrieval that outperforms monolithic reasoning while using far fewer tokens."}

This results in a ''Structure Gap'', where models trained on shallow reasoning chains fail to extrapolate to deeper recursive steps. In this work, we introduce Bifocal Attention, an architectural paradigm that decouples positional encoding into two distinct modalities: Geometric Eyes (Standard RoPE) for precise token-level manipulation, and Spectral Eyes (Learnable Harmonic Operators) for tracking long-range recursive depth.

Using controlled causal interventions on both raw and condensed forms of experience, we comprehensively evaluate four representative frameworks across 10 LLM backbones and 9 environments. Our analysis uncovers a striking asymmetry: while agents consistently depend on raw experience, they often disregard or misinterpret condensed experience, even when it is the only experience provided. This gap persists across single- and multi-agent configurations and across backbone scales. We trace its underlying causes to three factors: the semantic limitations of condensed content, internal processing biases that suppress experience, and task regimes where pretrained priors already suffice. These findings challenge prevailing assumptions about self-evolving methods and underscore the need for more faithful and reliable approaches to experience integration."}

However, existing methods typically employ binary rewards that fail to capture quality differences among trajectories achieving identical outcomes, thereby overlooking potential diversity within the solution space. Inspired by the ``sweet spot'' concept in tennis-the racket's core region that produces optimal hitting effects, we introduce \\textbf{S}weet \\textbf{S}pot \\textbf{L}earning (\\textbf{SSL}), a novel framework that provides differentiated guidance for agent optimization. SSL follows a simple yet effective principle: progressively amplified, tiered rewards guide policies toward the sweet-spot region of the solution space. This principle naturally adapts across diverse tasks: visual perception tasks leverage distance-tiered modeling to reward proximity, while complex reasoning tasks reward incremental progress toward promising solutions. We theoretically demonstrate that SSL preserves optimal solution ordering and enhances the gradient signal-to-noise ratio, thereby fostering more directed optimization. Extensive experiments across GUI perception, short/long-term planning, and complex reasoning tasks show consistent improvements over strong baselines on 12 benchmarks, achieving up to 2.5X sample efficiency gains and effective cross-task transferability. Our work establishes SSL as a general principle for training capable and robust agents."}

While reinforcement learning can help, progress has been limited by two structural bottlenecks: existing open-source agentic training data are narrow in task variety and easily solved; real-world APIs lack diversity and are unstable for large-scale reinforcement learning rollout processes. We address these challenges with SYNTHAGENT, a framework that jointly synthesizes diverse tool-use training data and simulates complete environments. Specifically, a strong teacher model creates novel tasks and tool ecosystems, then rewrites them into intentionally underspecified instructions. This compels agents to actively query users for missing details. When handling synthetic tasks, an LLM-based user simulator provides user-private information, while a mock tool system delivers stable tool responses. For rewards, task-level rubrics are constructed based on required subgoals, user-agent interactions, and forbidden behaviors. Across 14 challenging datasets in math, search, and tool use, models trained on our synthetic data achieve substantial gains, with small models outperforming larger baselines."}

While GMPO improves stability by constraining a conservative objective, it shares a fundamental limitation with GRPO: reliance on a fixed aggregation geometry that ignores the evolving and heterogeneous nature of each trajectory. In this work, we unify these approaches under Power-Mean Policy Optimization (PMPO), a generalized framework that parameterizes the aggregation geometry via the power-mean geometry exponent p. Within this framework, GRPO and GMPO are recovered as special cases. Theoretically, we demonstrate that adjusting p modulates the concentration of gradient updates, effectively reweighting tokens based on their advantage contribution. To determine p adaptively, we introduce a Clip-aware Effective Sample Size (ESS) mechanism. Specifically, we propose a deterministic rule that maps a trajectory clipping fraction to a target ESS. Then, we solve for the specific p to align the trajectory induced ESS with this target one. This allows PMPO to dynamically transition between the aggressive arithmetic mean for reliable trajectories and the conservative geometric mean for unstable ones. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PMPO outperforms strong baselines."}

To address this, we study the denoising dynamics and find that the implicit density ($ρ$) of end-of-sequence ($\\texttt{EOS}$) tokens serves as a reliable signal of generation sufficiency. In particular, the evolving implicit $\\texttt{EOS}$ density during denoising reveals whether the current masked space is excessive or insufficient, thereby guiding the adjustment direction for generation length. Building on this insight, we propose $\\textbf{$ρ$-$\\texttt{EOS}$}$, a training-free, single-stage strategy that enables bidirectional variable-length generation for masked dLLMs. Unlike prior two-stage approaches--which require separate length adjustment and iterative mask insertion phases while supporting only unidirectional expansion--$\\textbf{$ρ$-$\\texttt{EOS}$}$ achieves bidirectional length adjustment within a unified denoising process by continuously estimating the implicit $\\texttt{EOS}$ density: excessively high density triggers $\\texttt{MASK}$ token contraction, while insufficient density induces expansion.

We name this phenomenon the Holographic Characteristic of language models. For the purpose of exploring this characteristic and further improving the inference efficiency of language models, we propose a plugin called HOLO, which leverages the Holographic Characteristic to extract target-side keywords from language models within a limited number of generation steps and complements the sentence with a parallel lexically constrained text generation method. To verify the effectiveness of HOLO, we conduct massive experiments on language models of varying architectures and scales in the short-text generation scenario. The results demonstrate that HOLO achieves comparable performance to the baselines in terms of both automatic and human-like evaluation metrics and highlight the potential of the Holographic Characteristic."}

However, it is difficult to disentangle which evaluation biases are explained by narcissism versus general experimental confounds, distorting measurements of self-preference bias. We discover a core methodological confound which could reduce measurement error by 89.6%. Specifically, LLM evaluators may deliver self-preferring verdicts when the judge responds to queries which they completed incorrectly themselves; this would be true regardless of whether one of their responses is their own. To decouple self-preference signals from noisy outputs on hard problems, we introduce an Evaluator Quality Baseline, which compares the probability that a judge incorrectly votes for itself against the probability that it votes for an incorrect response from another model. Evaluating this simple baseline on 37,448 queries, only 51% of initial findings retain statistical significance. Finally, we turn towards characterizing the entropy of \"easy\" versus \"hard\" evaluation votes from LLM judges. Our corrective baseline enables future research on self-preference by eliminating noisy data from potential solutions. More widely, this work contributes to the growing body of work on cataloging and isolating judge-bias effects."}

In this work, we propose SpanNorm, a novel technique designed to resolve this dilemma by integrating the strengths of both paradigms. Structurally, SpanNorm establishes a clean residual connection that spans the entire transformer block to stabilize signal propagation, while employing a PostNorm-style computation that normalizes the aggregated output to enhance model performance. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that SpanNorm, combined with a principled scaling strategy, maintains bounded signal variance throughout the network, preventing the gradient issues that plague PostNorm models, and also alleviating the representation collapse of PreNorm. Empirically, SpanNorm consistently outperforms standard normalization schemes in both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) scenarios, paving the way for more powerful and stable Transformer architectures."}

In this work, we investigate whether smaller models can serve as efficient evaluators by leveraging internal representations instead of surface generation. We uncover a consistent empirical pattern: small LMs, despite with weak generative ability, encode rich evaluative signals in their hidden states. This motivates us to propose the Semantic Capacity Asymmetry Hypothesis: evaluation requires significantly less semantic capacity than generation and can be grounded in intermediate representations, suggesting that evaluation does not necessarily need to rely on large-scale generative models but can instead leverage latent features from smaller ones. Our findings motivate a paradigm shift from LLM-as-a-Judge to Representation-as-a-Judge, a decoding-free evaluation strategy that probes internal model structure rather than relying on prompted output. We instantiate this paradigm through INSPECTOR, a probing-based framework that predicts aspect-level evaluation scores from small model representations. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH, GPQA) show that INSPECTOR substantially outperforms prompting-based small LMs and closely approximates full LLM judges, while offering a more efficient, reliable, and interpretable alternative for scalable evaluation."}

To further enhance transfer ability, our method adaptively selects or blends modules based on their degree of specialization. Our approach preserves performance on general language understanding tasks while enhancing safety in the target languages. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves comparable performance to the language expert on general benchmarks such as MMMLU, BELEBELE, and MGSM, while producing more aligned and less harmful responses on the MultiJail safety benchmark."}

To address this, we introduce DART, i.e., Dynamic Attention-Guided Runtime Tracing), a lightweight, training-free method that performs on-the-fly context-based pruning. DART monitors shifts in attention score distributions to infer context changes, dynamically updating neuron-level masks to retain salient parameters.

By segregating structural encoding from semantic processing, these systems must perform a complex implicit alignment between abstract graph tokens and concrete textual elements. Challenging the necessity of external encoders, we propose NAG (Native Architecture for Graphs), a unified framework that internalizes graph processing within the LM's native manifold. Instead of bridging disparate embedding spaces, NAG repurposes the self-attention mechanism to enforce topological dependencies and recalibrates positional IDs to ensure structural equivalence. This allows the model to harness its intrinsic linguistic capability to simultaneously comprehend node and edge content alongside structural topology. We introduce two efficient implementations: NAG-Zero for absolute preservation of the base model's linguistic capabilities, and NAG-LoRA for enhanced structural adaptation. Experiments across diverse graph tasks validate that NAG achieves robust graph comprehension without the overhead of external encoders, offering a simpler, more coherent paradigm for text-graph modeling."}

We propose Retrieval-Augmented Simultaneous Speech Translation (RASST), which tightly integrates cross-modal retrieval into the SST pipeline.

We introduce here a technique to systematically quantify computation density in LLMs. In particular, we design a density estimator drawing on mechanistic interpretability. We experimentally test our estimator and find that: (1) contrary to what has been often assumed, LLM processing generally involves dense computation; (2) computation density is dynamic, in the sense that models shift between sparse and dense processing regimes depending on the input; (3) per-input density is significantly correlated across LLMs, suggesting that the same inputs trigger either low or high density. Investigating the factors influencing density, we observe that predicting rarer tokens requires higher density, and increasing context length often decreases the density.

We investigate the development of language-agnostic concept spaces during pretraining of EuroLLM through the causal interpretability method of activation patching. We isolate cross-lingual concept representations, then inject them into a translation prompt to investigate how consistently translations can be altered, independently of the language. We find that shared concept spaces emerge early} and continue to refine, but that alignment with them is language-dependent}. Furthermore, in contrast to prior work, our fine-grained manual analysis reveals that some apparent gains in translation quality reflect shifts in behavior -- like selecting senses for polysemous words or translating instead of copying cross-lingual homographs -- rather than improved translation ability.

This makes linguistically deep annotation difficult and complicates fine-grained analyses aimed at understanding why and how learners produce specific errors. To address these limitations, this paper presents a semi-automated annotation methodology for learner corpora, built upon a recently proposed faceted taxonomy, and implemented through a novel annotation extension framework. The taxonomy provides a theoretically grounded, multi-dimensional categorization that captures the linguistic properties underlying each error instance, thereby enabling standardized, fine-grained, and interpretable enrichment beyond flat annotations. The annotation extension tool, implemented based on the proposed extension framework for Turkish, automatically extends existing flat annotations by inferring additional linguistic and metadata information as facets within the taxonomy to provide richer learner-specific context. It was systematically evaluated and yielded promising performance results, achieving a facet-level accuracy of 95.86%. The resulting taxonomically enriched corpus offers enhanced querying capabilities and supports detailed exploratory analyses across learner corpora, enabling researchers to investigate error patterns through complex linguistic and pedagogical dimensions. This work introduces the first collaboratively annotated and taxonomically enriched Turkish Learner Corpus, a manual annotation guideline with a refined tagset, and an annotation extender. As the first corpus designed in accordance with the recently introduced taxonomy, we expect our study to pave the way for subsequent enrichment efforts of existing error-annotated learner corpora."}

Despite Türkiye's significant role in the global workforce, Turkish, a morphologically complex language, lacks both a skill taxonomy and a dedicated skill extraction dataset, resulting in underexplored research in skill extraction for Turkish. This article seeks the answers to three research questions: 1) How can skill extraction be effectively performed for this language, in light of its low resource nature? 2)~What is the most promising model? 3) What is the impact of different Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompting strategies on skill extraction (i.e., dynamic vs. static few-shot samples, varying context information, and encouraging causal reasoning)? The article introduces the first Turkish skill extraction dataset and performance evaluations of automated skill extraction using LLMs. The manually annotated dataset contains 4,819 labeled skill spans from 327 job postings across different occupation areas. The use of LLM outperforms supervised sequence labeling when used in an end-to-end pipeline, aligning extracted spans with standardized skills in the ESCO taxonomy more effectively. The best-performing configuration, utilizing Claude Sonnet 3.7 with dynamic few-shot prompting for skill identification, embedding-based retrieval, and LLM-based reranking for skill linking, achieves an end-to-end performance of 0.56, positioning Turkish alongside similar studies in other languages, which are few in the literature. Our findings suggest that LLMs can improve skill extraction performance in low-resource settings, and we hope that our work will accelerate similar research on skill extraction for underrepresented languages."}

Our approach challenges the assumption that models should mirror users' morphosyntactic features, showing that up to 90% of the grammatical features of a dialect should not be reproduced by models.

However, despite their ubiquitous use, the exact mechanisms underlying their outstanding performance remain unclear. Different methods for LLM explainability exist, and many are, as a method, not fully understood themselves. We started with the question of how linguistic abstraction emerges in LLMs, aiming to detect it across different LLM modules (attention heads and input embeddings). For this, we used methods well-established in the literature: (1) probing for token-level relational structures, and (2) feature-mapping using embeddings as carriers of human-interpretable properties.\n  Both attempts failed for different methodological reasons: Attention-based explanations collapsed once we tested the core assumption that later-layer representations still correspond to tokens. Property-inference methods applied to embeddings also failed because their high predictive scores were driven by methodological artifacts and dataset structure rather than meaningful semantic knowledge. These failures matter because both techniques are widely treated as evidence for what LLMs supposedly understand, yet our results show such conclusions are unwarranted. These limitations are particularly relevant in pervasive and distributed computing settings where LLMs are deployed as system components and interpretability methods are relied upon for debugging, compression, and explaining models."}

Specifically, we identify two primary obstacles: (1) data scarcity, as high-quality parallel data requires bilingual annotators familiar with platform-specific slang, and stylistic cues in both languages; and (2) metric limitations, where traditional evaluators like COMET often fail to capture stylistic fidelity and nonstandard expressions. To bridge these gaps, we introduce CSM-MTBench, a benchmark covering five Chinese-foreign language directions and consisting of two expert-curated subsets: Fun Posts, featuring context-rich, slang- and neologism-heavy content, and Social Snippets, emphasizing concise, emotion- and style- driven expressions. Furthermore, we propose tailored evaluation approaches for each subset: measuring the translation success rate of slang and neologisms in Fun Posts, while assessing tone and style preservation in Social Snippets via a hybrid of embedding-based metrics and LLM-as-a-judge. Experiments on over 20 models reveal substantial variation in how current MT systems handle semantic fidelity and informal, social-media-specific stylistic cues. CSM-MTBench thus serves as a rigorous testbed for advancing MT systems capable of mastering real-world Chinese social media texts."}

We hypothesize that one cause of this gap is that strict positional prediction makes MDLM decoding highly sensitive to token misalignment, and we show through controlled interventions that a one-position shift can severely disrupt semantics. This observation suggests that enforcing strict positional supervision during training is misaligned with the irreversible denoising dynamics of MDLM decoding. Motivated by this mismatch, we adopt an alignment-flexible supervision strategy during fine-tuning. Specifically, we introduce a special token <slack> via the connectionist temporal classification objective. We apply this approach to the widely used MDLM model and conduct experiments on five open-ended text generation benchmarks. Our method consistently outperforms the original model and improves robustness to positional shifts, indicating that relaxing strict positional supervision is an important factor in improving generation quality in MDLMs."}

To address the limitations of predefined prompts, we introduce a fraud-aware selective CoT distillation mechanism that generates diverse reasoning paths and enhances semantic-structural understanding. These distilled CoTs are integrated into node texts, providing GNNs with enriched, multi-hop semantic and structural cues for fraud detection. Furthermore, we develop an efficient asymmetric co-training strategy that enables end-to-end optimization while significantly reducing the computational cost of naive joint training.

We demonstrate that recycling computation from the discarded tokens is beneficial, as these tokens retain contextual information useful for subsequent decoding iterations. In light of this, we propose Residual Context Diffusion (RCD), a module that converts these discarded token representations into contextual residuals and injects them back for the next denoising step. RCD uses a decoupled two-stage training pipeline to bypass the memory bottlenecks associated with backpropagation. We validate our method on both long CoT reasoning (SDAR) and short CoT instruction following (LLaDA) models. We demonstrate that a standard dLLM can be efficiently converted to the RCD paradigm with merely ~1 billion tokens. RCD consistently improves frontier dLLMs by 5-10 points in accuracy with minimal extra computation overhead across a wide range of benchmarks. Notably, on the most challenging AIME tasks, RCD nearly doubles baseline accuracy and attains up to 4-5x fewer denoising steps at equivalent accuracy levels."}

We term this phenomenon \\textit{outlier-driven rescaling} and validate this hypothesis across different model architectures and training token counts. This view unifies the origin and mitigation of both sink types. Our main conclusions and observations include: (1) Outliers function jointly with normalization: removing normalization eliminates the corresponding outliers but degrades training stability and performance; directly clipping outliers while retaining normalization leads to degradation, indicating that outlier-driven rescaling contributes to training stability. (2) Outliers serve more as rescale factors rather than contributors, as the final contributions of attention and residual sinks are significantly smaller than those of non-outliers. (3) Outliers can be absorbed into learnable parameters or mitigated via explicit gated rescaling, leading to improved training performance (average gain of 2 points) and enhanced quantization robustness (1.2 points degradation under W4A4 quantization)."}

To address this limitation, we adopt a dimensional approach that represents sentiment with continuous valence-arousal (VA) scores, enabling fine-grained analysis at both the aspect and sentiment levels. To this end, we introduce DimABSA, the first multilingual, dimensional ABSA resource annotated with both traditional ABSA elements (aspect terms, aspect categories, and opinion terms) and newly introduced VA scores. This resource contains 76,958 aspect instances across 42,590 sentences, spanning six languages and four domains. We further introduce three subtasks that combine VA scores with different ABSA elements, providing a bridge from traditional ABSA to dimensional ABSA. Given that these subtasks involve both categorical and continuous outputs, we propose a new unified metric, continuous F1 (cF1), which incorporates VA prediction error into standard F1. We provide a comprehensive benchmark using both prompted and fine-tuned large language models across all subtasks.

Across multiple domains and model families, we find that fine-tuning models on data exhibiting specific character-level dispositions induces substantially stronger and more transferable misalignment than incorrect-advice fine-tuning, while largely preserving general capabilities. This indicates that emergent misalignment arises from stable shifts in model behavior rather than from capability degradation or corrupted knowledge. We further show that such behavioral dispositions can be conditionally activated by both training-time triggers and inference-time persona-aligned prompts, revealing shared structure across emergent misalignment, backdoor activation, and jailbreak susceptibility. Overall, our results identify character formation as a central and underexplored alignment risk, suggesting that robust alignment must address behavioral dispositions rather than isolated errors or prompt-level defenses."}

Recent latent reasoning methods attempt to mitigate this by compressing reasoning processes into latent space, but often suffer from severe performance degradation due to the lack of appropriate compression guidance. In this study, we propose Rendered CoT-Guided variational Latent Reasoning (ReGuLaR), a simple yet novel latent learning paradigm resolving this issue. Fundamentally, we formulate latent reasoning within the Variational Auto-Encoding (VAE) framework, sampling the current latent reasoning state from the posterior distribution conditioned on previous ones. Specifically, when learning this variational latent reasoning model, we render explicit reasoning chains as images, from which we extract dense visual-semantic representations to regularize the posterior distribution, thereby achieving efficient compression with minimal information loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReGuLaR significantly outperforms existing latent reasoning methods across both computational efficiency and reasoning effectiveness, and even surpasses CoT through multi-modal reasoning, providing a new and insightful solution to latent reasoning.

However, their practical failures often stem from the lack of mechanisms to monitor and regulate reasoning and retrieval states as tasks evolve under uncertainty. Insights from cognitive neuroscience suggest that human metacognition is hierarchically organized, integrating fast anomaly detection with selectively triggered, experience-driven reflection. In this work, we propose Deep Search with Meta-Cognitive Monitoring (DS-MCM), a deep search framework augmented with an explicit hierarchical metacognitive monitoring mechanism. DS-MCM integrates a Fast Consistency Monitor, which performs lightweight checks on the alignment between external evidence and internal reasoning confidence, and a Slow Experience-Driven Monitor, which is selectively activated to guide corrective intervention based on experience memory from historical agent trajectories. By embedding monitoring directly into the reasoning-retrieval loop, DS-MCM determines both when intervention is warranted and how corrective actions should be informed by prior experience. Experiments across multiple deep search benchmarks and backbone models demonstrate that DS-MCM consistently improves performance and robustness."}

Smith"], "title": "Are you going to finish that? A Practical Study of the Tokenization Boundary Problem", "comment": null, "summary": "Language models (LMs) are trained over sequences of tokens, whereas users interact with LMs via text. This mismatch gives rise to the partial token problem, which occurs when a user ends their prompt in the middle of the expected next-token, leading to distorted next-token predictions. Although this issue has been studied using arbitrary character prefixes, its prevalence and severity in realistic prompts respecting word boundaries remains underexplored. In this work, we identify three domains where token and \"word\" boundaries often do not line up: languages that do not use whitespace, highly compounding languages, and code. In Chinese, for example, up to 25% of word boundaries do not line up with token boundaries, making even natural, word-complete prompts susceptible to this problem. We systematically construct semantically natural prompts ending with a partial tokens; in experiments, we find that they comprise a serious failure mode: frontier LMs consistently place three orders of magnitude less probability on the correct continuation compared to when the prompt is \"backed-off\" to be token-aligned. This degradation does not diminish with scale and often worsens for larger models. Finally, we evaluate inference-time mitigations to the partial token problem and validate the effectiveness of recent exact solutions. Overall, we demonstrate the scale and severity of probability distortion caused by tokenization in realistic use cases, and provide practical recommentions for model inference providers."}

This transition, however, introduces a distinct class of vulnerabilities that remain largely uncharacterized. We examine the security implications of this modality shift by designing a text-to-audio jailbreak that embeds disallowed directives within a narrative-style audio stream. The attack leverages an advanced instruction-following text-to-speech (TTS) model to exploit structural and acoustic properties, thereby circumventing safety mechanisms primarily calibrated for text. When delivered through synthetic speech, the narrative format elicits restricted outputs from state-of-the-art models, including Gemini 2.0 Flash, achieving a 98.26% success rate that substantially exceeds text-only baselines. These results highlight the need for safety frameworks that jointly reason over linguistic and paralinguistic representations, particularly as speech-based interfaces become more prevalent."}

Powered by state-of-the-art VLMs and image generation models, PaperBanana orchestrates specialized agents to retrieve references, plan content and style, render images, and iteratively refine via self-critique. To rigorously evaluate our framework, we introduce PaperBananaBench, comprising 292 test cases for methodology diagrams curated from NeurIPS 2025 publications, covering diverse research domains and illustration styles. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that PaperBanana consistently outperforms leading baselines in faithfulness, conciseness, readability, and aesthetics. We further show that our method effectively extends to the generation of high-quality statistical plots. Collectively, PaperBanana paves the way for the automated generation of publication-ready illustrations."}

While this formulation enables the use of advanced planning algorithms, these methods typically assume access to supervised reward signals, which are often unavailable in practical scenarios. In this work, we propose UPA, an Unsupervised Prompt Agent that realizes structured search and selection without relying on supervised feedback. Specifically, during search, UPA iteratively constructs an evolving tree structure to navigate the prompt space, guided by fine-grained and order-invariant pairwise comparisons from Large Language Models (LLMs). Crucially, as these local comparisons do not inherently yield a consistent global scale, we decouple systematic prompt exploration from final selection, introducing a two-stage framework grounded in the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model. This framework first performs path-wise Bayesian aggregation of local comparisons to filter candidates under uncertainty, followed by global tournament-style comparisons to infer latent prompt quality and identify the optimal prompt. Experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate that UPA consistently outperforms existing prompt optimization methods, showing that agent-style optimization remains highly effective even in fully unsupervised settings."}
