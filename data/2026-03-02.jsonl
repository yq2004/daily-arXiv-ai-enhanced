Traditional discriminative models are constrained by fixed windows and cannot model document-level semantics; generative large language models can output paragraph boundaries, but inference is expensive and long inputs are difficult to support. To address these issues, we propose a discriminative segmentation model based on Qwen3-0.6B. On top of the backbone network, we add a cross-window context fusion layer and a boundary classification head, and combine them with an overlapping sliding-window strategy. Our model supports single-pass inputs of up to 13k tokens and can be extended to ultra-long documents for paragraph boundary detection. To further enhance downstream retrieval efficiency, we derive a vector fusion method with scalar correction, which compresses the representation of ultra-long segments into a single vector without semantic loss. Experiments on the Wikipedia long-document topic segmentation dataset WIKI-727K show that, compared with three generative models based on Qwen2-0.5B released by Jina, our method achieves a better macro-averaged F1 and delivers two orders of magnitude faster inference, substantially improving the practicality and scalability of long-document processing."}

However, limited awareness of existing task-specific resources in low-resource languages hinders research. This challenge is especially acute in linguistically diverse countries, such as India. Cross-task profiling of existing Indian speech datasets can alleviate the data scarcity challenge. This involves investigating the utility of datasets across multiple downstream tasks rather than focusing on a single task. Prior surveys typically catalogue datasets for a single task, leaving comprehensive cross-task profiling as an open opportunity. Therefore, we propose Task-Lens, a cross-task survey that assesses the readiness of 50 Indian speech datasets spanning 26 languages for nine downstream speech tasks. First, we analyze which datasets contain metadata and properties suitable for specific tasks. Next, we propose task-aligned enhancements to unlock datasets to their full downstream potential. Finally, we identify tasks and Indian languages that are critically underserved by current resources. Our findings reveal that many Indian speech datasets contain untapped metadata that can support multiple downstream tasks. By uncovering cross-task linkages and gaps, Task-Lens enables researchers to explore the broader applicability of existing datasets and to prioritize dataset creation for underserved tasks and languages."}

Process-reward methods like StepSearch alleviate this by introducing step-level supervision, but rely on heuristic rewards such as TF-IDF overlap with gold documents, and still sample k complete trajectories per example, retaining high gradient variance. We propose SLATE, a framework built on two complementary ideas: (1) truncated step-level sampling, which generates k trajectories that share a common prefix and differ only at the next step, and (2) dense LLM-as-judge rewards, which replace heuristic scoring with a capable LLM evaluator that assesses the quality of each reasoning step, search query, and answer, providing richer and more reliable supervision. We theoretically prove that under the same dense reward structure, truncated sampling reduces the variance of advantage estimates by up to a factor of T compared to full-trajectory sampling for T-step trajectories, yielding lower-variance, better-targeted policy gradients. Experiments on seven QA benchmarks confirm that SLATE consistently outperforms both sparse-reward and process-reward baselines, with the largest gains on harder multi-hop tasks and smaller models."}

A Benchmark for Verifying Scientific References in the LLM Era", "comment": null, "summary": "Scientific research relies on accurate citation for attribution and integrity, yet large language models (LLMs) introduce a new risk: fabricated references that appear plausible but correspond to no real publications. Such hallucinated citations have already been observed in submissions and accepted papers at major machine learning venues, exposing vulnerabilities in peer review. Meanwhile, rapidly growing reference lists make manual verification impractical, and existing automated tools remain fragile to noisy and heterogeneous citation formats and lack standardized evaluation. We present the first comprehensive benchmark and detection framework for hallucinated citations in scientific writing. Our multi-agent verification pipeline decomposes citation checking into claim extraction, evidence retrieval, passage matching, reasoning, and calibrated judgment to assess whether a cited source truly supports its claim. We construct a large-scale human-validated dataset across domains and define unified metrics for citation faithfulness and evidence alignment. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs reveal substantial citation errors and show that our framework significantly outperforms prior methods in both accuracy and interpretability.

We question how much additional value vector databases and semantic search bring to RAG over simple, agentic keyword search in documents for question-answering. In this study, we conducted a systematic comparison between RAG-based systems and tool-augmented LLM agents, specifically evaluating their retrieval mechanisms and response quality when the agent only has access to basic keyword search tools. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that tool-based keyword search implementations within an agentic framework can attain over $90\\%$ of the performance metrics compared to traditional RAG systems without using a standing vector database. Our approach is simple to implement, cost effective, and is particularly useful in scenarios requiring frequent updates to knowledge bases."}

In this paper, we extend this paradigm with TTE-v2, a hybrid multimodal retrieval framework that introduces reasoning-driven performance scaling based on additional input token budget rather than model or embedding size. Our approach augments the initial multimodal retrieval with additional reasoning steps for reranking, enabling more expressive query-candidate interactions at test time. The reranking stage further provides fine-grained supervision for hard negative mining and false negative filtering, creating a feedback loop that effectively strengthens the upstream retriever. This cascaded design delivers substantial test-time improvements based on intermediate reasoning token scaling. Experiments on the MMEB-V2 benchmark demonstrate that TTE-v2-7B achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 75.7%, and that TTE-v2-2B matches or surpasses leading 7B models trained with significantly larger external data.

The system integrates three specialized RAG pipelines covering Supreme Court case law, statutory and constitutional texts, and the Indian Penal Code, each optimized for domain specific retrieval. To enable relational reasoning beyond semantic similarity, we construct a Neo4j based Legal Knowledge Graph capturing structured relationships among cases, statutes, IPC sections, judges, and citations.

We introduce ProbCOPA, a dataset of 210 handcrafted probabilistic inferences in English, each annotated for inference likelihood by 25--30 human participants. We find that human responses are graded and varied, revealing probabilistic judgments of the inferences in our dataset. Comparing these judgments with responses from eight state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, we show that models consistently fail to produce human-like distributions. Finally, analyzing LLM reasoning chains, we find evidence of a common reasoning pattern used to evaluate such inferences.

While social media platforms offer opportunities for early risk detection through online conversation trees, existing approaches face two major limitations: (1) They rely on predefined rules (e.g., quotes or relies) to log conversations that capture only a narrow spectrum of user interactions, and (2) They overlook hidden influences such as user conformity and suicide copycat behavior, which can significantly affect suicidal expression and propagation in online communities. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Agent Causal Reasoning (MACR) framework that collaboratively employs a Reasoning Agent to scale user interactions and a Bias-aware Decision-Making Agent to mitigate harmful biases arising from hidden influences. The Reasoning Agent integrates cognitive appraisal theory to generate counterfactual user reactions to posts, thereby scaling user interactions. It analyses these reactions through structured dimensions, i.e., cognitive, emotional, and behavioral patterns, with a dedicated sub-agent responsible for each dimension. The Bias-aware Decision-Making Agent mitigates hidden biases through a front-door adjustment strategy, leveraging the counterfactual user reactions produced by the Reasoning Agent. Through the collaboration of reasoning and bias-aware decision making, the proposed MACR framework not only alleviates hidden biases, but also enriches contextual information of user interactions with counterfactual knowledge. Extensive experiments on real-world conversational datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of MACR in identifying suicide risk."}

However, these systems face significant risks of bias amplification, where model prediction gaps between student groups become larger than those observed in training data. This issue is especially severe for underrepresented groups such as English Language Learners (ELLs), as models may inherit and further magnify existing disparities in the data. We identify that this issue is closely tied to representation bias: the scarcity of minority (high-scoring ELL) samples makes models trained with empirical risk minimization favor majority (non-ELL) linguistic patterns. Consequently, models tend to under-predict ELL students who even demonstrate comparable domain knowledge but use different linguistic patterns, thereby undermining the fairness of automated scoring outcomes. To mitigate this, we propose BRIDGE, a Bias-Reducing Inter-group Data GEneration framework designed for low-resource assessment settings. Instead of relying on the limited minority samples, BRIDGE synthesizes high-scoring ELL samples by \"pasting\" construct-relevant (i.e., rubric-aligned knowledge and evidence) content from abundant high-scoring non-ELL samples into authentic ELL linguistic patterns. We further introduce a discriminator model to ensure the quality of synthetic samples. Experiments on California Science Test (CAST) datasets demonstrate that BRIDGE effectively reduces prediction bias for high-scoring ELL students while maintaining overall scoring performance. Notably, our method achieves fairness gains comparable to using additional real human data, offering a cost-effective solution for ensuring equitable scoring in large-scale assessments."}

Modern systems therefore rely on multiple specialized retrieval channels to surface products, each designed to satisfy a specific objective. A key challenge is how to effectively merge documents from these heterogeneous channels into a single ranked list under strict latency constraints while optimizing for business KPIs such as user conversion. Rank-based fusion methods such as Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) and Weighted Interleaving rely on fixed global channel weights and treat channels independently, failing to account for query-specific channel utility and cross-channel interactions. We observe that multi-channel fusion can be reformulated as a query-dependent learning-to-rank problem over heterogeneous candidate sources. In this paper, we propose a unified ranking model that learns to merge and rank documents from multiple retrieval channels. We formulate the problem as a channel-aware learning-to-rank task that jointly optimizes clicks, add-to-carts, and purchases while incorporating channel-specific objectives. We further incorporate recent user behavioral signals to capture short-term intent shifts that are critical for improving conversion in multi-channel ranking. Our online A/B experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms rank-based fusion methods, leading to a +2.85\\% improvement in user conversion.

These queries exhibit diverse linguistic patterns, often lack explicit purchase intent, and require domain-specific knowledge reasoning for accurate interpretation. They also suffer from a shortage of reliable behavioral logs, which makes such queries a persistent challenge for retrieval optimization. To address these issues, we propose an efficient data synthesis framework tailored to retrieval involving long-tail, knowledge-intensive queries. The key idea is to implicitly distill the capabilities of a powerful offline query-rewriting model into an efficient online retrieval system. Leveraging the strong language understanding of LLMs, we train a multi-candidate query rewriting model with multiple reward signals and capture its rewriting capability in well-curated query-product pairs through a powerful offline retrieval pipeline. This design mitigates distributional shift in rewritten queries, which might otherwise limit incremental recall or introduce irrelevant products. Experiments demonstrate that without any additional tricks, simply incorporating this synthetic data into retrieval model training leads to significant improvements.

However, existing benchmarks do not sufficiently reflect the complexity of real-world scenarios, which limits their effectiveness in evaluating and enhancing LLM reasoning in practical contexts. Many current reasoning datasets are overly simplistic and abstract, often disconnected from realistic task flows, domain constraints, and operational rules, making it difficult to effectively evaluate LLMs' logical reasoning ability. In addition, data contamination from pretraining corpora undermines the reliability of evaluation results, and traditional crowdsourcing methods for dataset construction are labor-intensive and difficult to scale. To address these challenges, we propose a LLM-driven framework for synthesizing multi-turn, task-oriented dialogues grounded in realistic reasoning scenarios, leveraging trilevel optimization to enhance dialogue quality. Our method generates dialogues grounded in authentic task scenarios, enriched with real-world information, and exhibiting strong contextual coherence.

However, existing GR models typically perform single-pass decoding without explicit refinement, causing early deviations to accumulate and ultimately degrade recommendation quality. To tackle this problem, we propose GRC, which is, to our knowledge, the first structured reflection-correction framework for GR that extends standard decoding into a Generation-Reflection-Correction (GRC) process. Concretely, GRC introduces a supervised reflection-correction template that decomposes the decoding process into initial draft generation, multi-granular reflection, and reflection-guided correction, thereby enabling structured reflection and correction in the semantic token space. To further explore the enlarged refinement space introduced by the GRC process, we optimize the entire GRC trajectory with GRPO-based reinforcement learning, under a carefully designed reward function with token-level and trajectory-level signals. For efficient online serving, we propose an Entropy-Guided Reflection Scheduling (EGRS) strategy that dynamically allocates more correction budget to high-uncertainty decoding trajectories during beam search. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that GRC consistently outperforms six state-of-the-art baselines by up to 15.74%, and online A/B tests demonstrate its substantial practical value in large-scale industrial recommendation, delivering a 1.79% lift in advertising revenue with only modest latency overhead."}

However, existing approaches largely rely on rule-based systems or traditional machine learning models, which struggle with semantic ambiguity, domain dependency, and limited generalization when processing complex patent language. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown strong semantic understanding capabilities, yet their direct application to TRIZ parameter extraction remains challenging due to hallucination and insufficient grounding in structured TRIZ knowledge. To address these limitations, this paper proposes TRIZ-RAGNER, a retrieval-augmented large language model framework for TRIZ-aware named entity recognition in patent-based contradiction mining. TRIZ-RAGNER reformulates contradiction mining as a semantic-level NER task and integrates dense retrieval over a TRIZ knowledge base, cross-encoder reranking for context refinement, and structured LLM prompting to extract improving and worsening parameters from patent sentences. By injecting domain-specific TRIZ knowledge into the LLM reasoning process, the proposed framework effectively reduces semantic noise and improves extraction consistency. Experiments on the PaTRIZ dataset demonstrate that TRIZ-RAGNER consistently outperforms traditional sequence labeling models and LLM-based baselines. The proposed framework achieves a precision of 85.6%, a recall of 82.9%, and an F1-score of 84.2% in TRIZ contradiction pair identification. Compared with the strongest baseline using prompt-enhanced GPT, TRIZ-RAGNER yields an absolute F1-score improvement of 7.3 percentage points, confirming the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented TRIZ knowledge grounding for robust and accurate patent-based contradiction mining."}

To overcome these limitations, we propose an agent-centric benchmarking paradigm that moves beyond static datasets by introducing a dynamic protocol in which autonomous agents iteratively generate, validate, and solve problems. Within this protocol, a teacher agent generates candidate problems, an orchestrator agent rigorously verifies their validity and guards against adversarial attacks, and a student agent attempts to solve the validated problems. An invalid problem is revised by the teacher agent until it passes validation. If the student correctly solves the problem, the orchestrator prompts the teacher to generate more challenging variants. Consequently, the benchmark scales in difficulty automatically as more capable agents are substituted into any role, enabling progressive evaluation of large language models without manually curated datasets. Adopting text anomaly detection as our primary evaluation format, which demands cross-sentence logical inference and resists pattern-matching shortcuts, we demonstrate that this protocol systematically exposes corner-case reasoning errors that conventional benchmarks fail to reveal. We further advocate evaluating systems along several complementary axes including cross-model pairwise performance and progress between the initial and orchestrator-finalized problems. By shifting the focus from fixed datasets to dynamic protocols, our approach offers a sustainable direction for evaluating ever-evolving language models and introduces a research agenda centered on the co-evolution of agent-centric benchmarks."}

While linear attention is a promising alternative, existing research faces three critical challenges: (1) temporal signals are often overlooked or integrated via naive coupling that causes mutual interference between temporal and semantic signals while neglecting behavioral periodicity; (2) insufficient positional information provided by existing linear frameworks; and (3) a primary focus on short sequences and shallow architectures. To address these issues, we propose FuXi-Linear, a linear-complexity model designed for efficient long-sequence recommendation. Our approach introduces two key components: (1) a Temporal Retention Channel that independently computes periodic attention weights using temporal data, preventing crosstalk between temporal and semantic signals; (2) a Linear Positional Channel that integrates positional information through learnable kernels within linear complexity. Moreover, we demonstrate that FuXi-Linear exhibits a robust power-law scaling property at a thousand-length scale, a characteristic largely unexplored in prior linear recommendation studies. Extensive experiments on sequences of several thousand tokens demonstrate that FuXi-Linear outperforms state-of-the-art models in recommendation quality, while achieving up to 10$\\times$ speedup in the prefill stage and up to 21$\\times$ speedup in the decode stage compared to competitive baselines.

The framework first uses a pretrained language model to encode the input text and obtain basic semantic representations. It then introduces structured prompts composed of multi-dimensional semantic factors and integrates them with text features through a learnable combination mechanism, which forms task-related representations with clear boundaries in the latent space. To further strengthen the consistency between text representations and label semantics, the method constructs a structured label embedding matrix and employs a cross-space alignment mechanism to ensure stable matching between textual features and label attributes. In addition, the model applies prompt orthogonality constraints and a joint optimization objective to maintain independence across different semantic factors in the prompts, allowing the structured prompts to provide transparent and controllable guidance for classification decisions. Three types of sensitivity experiments, including learning rate sensitivity, prompt length sensitivity, and data scale sensitivity, are designed to evaluate the stability and robustness of the framework under different conditions. Experimental results show that the proposed structured prompt optimization framework effectively alleviates semantic conflicts and label ambiguity in few-shot text classification. It significantly improves performance on accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC, and demonstrates strong cross-task applicability."}

Search filters play an important role in helping guests navigate this variety by refining search results to align with their needs.

We introduce a modeling framework that directly targets lower-funnel conversions (bookings) by recommending intermediate tools, i.e. search filters. Leveraging the framework, we designed and built the filter recommendation system at Airbnb from the ground up, addressing challenges like cold start and stringent serving requirements.\n  The filter recommendation system we developed has been successfully deployed at Airbnb, powering multiple user interfaces and driving incremental booking conversion lifts, as validated through online A/B testing. An ablation study further validates the effectiveness of our approach and key design choices. By focusing on conversion-oriented filter recommendations, our work ensures that search filters serve their ultimate purpose at Airbnb - helping guests find and book their ideal accommodations."}

Unlike autoregressive LLMs that generate one token per step based on all previous tokens, dLLMs theoretically enable parallel generation of multiple tokens at each decoding step. However, recent dLLMs still favor one-token-per-step generation in practice, as directly decoding multiple masked tokens often leads to degraded generation quality and stability. This reveals a substantial gap between the theoretical parallelism and practical performance of dLLMs. To bridge this gap, we introduce an adaptive parallel decoding approach, namely DiCo, which features a three-phase divide-and-conquer paradigm to unleash the inherent parallelism of dLLMs. During the Divide phase, DiCo first explores the input masked sequence and identifies masked tokens as seed tokens, which are then expanded to construct a set of local clusters. During the Conquer phase, DiCo performs parallel decoding across different local clusters constructed in the Divide phase. The divide-and-conquer process repeatedly alternates between the Divide and Conquer phases until convergence. During the Finalize phase, DiCo decodes the remaining few masked tokens using an effective fine-grained compound decoding scheme to finalize the generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiCo can achieve significant inference speedups while maintaining competitive generation quality."}

This change has led to systematic mismatches between document-centric models and question-driven retrieval, including (1) input granularity (long documents vs. short questions), (2) semantic focus (scientific discourse structure vs. specific question intent), and (3) training signals (citation-based similarity vs. question-oriented relevance). To this end, we propose UniFAR, a Unified Facet-Aware Retrieval framework to jointly support doc-doc and q-doc SDR within a single architecture. UniFAR reconciles granularity differences through adaptive multi-granularity aggregation, aligns document structure with question intent via learnable facet anchors, and unifies doc-doc and q-doc supervision through joint training. Experimental results show that UniFAR consistently outperforms prior methods across multiple retrieval tasks and base models, confirming its effectiveness and generality."}

As a result, many agentic search systems remain impractical despite their impressive performance. In this work, we introduce HotelQuEST, a benchmark comprising 214 hotel search queries that range from simple factual requests to complex queries, enabling evaluation across the full spectrum of query difficulty. We further address the challenge of evaluating underspecified user preferences by collecting clarifications that make annotators' implicit preferences explicit for evaluation.

Our analysis exposes inefficiencies in current agentic search systems and demonstrates substantial potential for cost-aware optimization."}

We construct a mixed, multi-domain Chinese professional writing dataset spanning current affairs, finance, law, and medicine. We then conduct a systematic study of LLM-based correction paradigms, from prompting to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agentic workflows. The analysis reveals practical challenges, including limited generalization of specialized correction models, the need for evidence grounding for factual repair, the difficulty of mixed-error paragraphs, and over-correction on clean inputs. Results further show that handling linguistic and factual Error within the same context outperform decoupled processes, and that agentic workflows can be effective with suitable backbone models.

Yet, this setting introduces two intertwined difficulties. On the one hand, individual clients typically contribute only short and highly sparse interaction sequences, limiting the reliability of learned user representations. On the other hand, the federated optimisation process is vulnerable to malicious or corrupted client updates, where poisoned gradients can significantly distort the global model. These challenges are particularly severe in sequential recommendation, where temporal dynamics further complicate signal aggregation. To address this problem, we propose a robust aggregation framework tailored for federated sequential recommendation under sparse and adversarial conditions. Instead of relying on standard averaging, our method introduces a defence-aware aggregation mechanism that identifies and down-weights unreliable client updates while preserving informative signals from sparse but benign participants. The framework incorporates representation-level constraints to stabilise user and item embeddings, preventing poisoned or anomalous contributions from dominating the global parameter space. In addition, we integrate sequence-aware regularisation to maintain temporal coherence in user modelling despite limited local observations."}

Users receive product recommendations from recommendation systems. Cinematic recommendations are made to users by a movie recommendation system.

A regression model was built using novel properties extracted from the dataset and used as features in the model. For experimentation, the Netflix challenge dataset has been used. Video streaming service Netflix is a popular choice for many. Customers' prior viewing habits are taken into account when Netflix makes movie recommendations to them. An exploratory data analysis on the Netflix dataset was conducted to gain insights into user rating behaviour and movie characteristics. Various kinds of features, including aggregating, Matrix Factorization (MF) based, and user and movie similarity based, have been extracted in the subsequent stages. In addition to a feature in the XGBoost regression algorithm, the K-Nearest Neighbors and MF algorithms from Python's Surprise library are used for recommendations. Based on Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), MF-based algorithms have provided the best recommendations."}

Our findings reveal that reasoning effectiveness is strongly task-dependent, challenging prevailing assumptions: (1) Reasoning shows task-complexity dependence--binary classification degrades up to -19.9 F1 percentage points (pp), while 27-class emotion recognition gains up to +16.0pp; (2) Distilled reasoning variants underperform base models by 3-18 pp on simpler tasks, though few-shot prompting enables partial recovery; (3) Few-shot learning improves over zero-shot in most cases regardless of model type, with gains varying by architecture and task complexity; (4) Pareto frontier analysis shows base models dominate efficiency-performance trade-offs, with reasoning justified only for complex emotion recognition despite 2.1x-54x computational overhead. We complement these quantitative findings with qualitative error analysis revealing that reasoning degrades simpler tasks through systematic over-deliberation, offering mechanistic insight beyond the high-level overthinking hypothesis."}

The TREC 2025 DRAGUN (Detection, Retrieval, and Augmented Generation for Understanding News) Track provided a venue for researchers to develop and evaluate assistive RAG systems that support readers' news trustworthiness assessment by producing reader-oriented, well-attributed reports. As the organizers of the DRAGUN track, we describe the resources that we have newly developed to allow for the reuse of the track's tasks. The track had two tasks: (Task 1) Question Generation, producing 10 ranked investigative questions; and (Task 2, the main task) Report Generation, producing a 250-word report grounded in the MS MARCO V2.1 Segmented Corpus. As part of the track's evaluation, we had TREC assessors create importance-weighted rubrics of questions with expected short answers for 30 different news articles. These rubrics represent the information that assessors believe is important for readers to assess an article's trustworthiness. The assessors then used their rubrics to manually judge the participating teams' submitted runs. To make these tasks and their rubrics reusable, we have created an automated process to judge runs not part of the original assessing. We show that our AutoJudge ranks existing runs well compared to the TREC human-assessed evaluation (Kendall's $τ= 0.678$ for Task 1 and $τ= 0.872$ for Task 2). These resources enable both the evaluation of RAG systems for assistive news trustworthiness assessment and, with the human evaluation as a benchmark, research on improving automated RAG evaluation."}

Traditional discriminative models are constrained by fixed windows and cannot model document-level semantics; generative large language models can output paragraph boundaries, but inference is expensive and long inputs are difficult to support. To address these issues, we propose a discriminative segmentation model based on Qwen3-0.6B. On top of the backbone network, we add a cross-window context fusion layer and a boundary classification head, and combine them with an overlapping sliding-window strategy. Our model supports single-pass inputs of up to 13k tokens and can be extended to ultra-long documents for paragraph boundary detection. To further enhance downstream retrieval efficiency, we derive a vector fusion method with scalar correction, which compresses the representation of ultra-long segments into a single vector without semantic loss. Experiments on the Wikipedia long-document topic segmentation dataset WIKI-727K show that, compared with three generative models based on Qwen2-0.5B released by Jina, our method achieves a better macro-averaged F1 and delivers two orders of magnitude faster inference, substantially improving the practicality and scalability of long-document processing."}

We evaluate translations by three commercial LLMs (Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT) of twenty paragraph-length passages from two works by the Greek physician Galen of Pergamum (ca. 129-216 CE): On Mixtures, which has two published English translations, and On the Composition of Drugs according to Kinds, which has never been fully translated into English. We assess translation quality using both standard automated evaluation metrics (BLEU, chrF++, METEOR, ROUGE-L, BERTScore, COMET, BLEURT) and expert human evaluation via a modified Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) framework applied to all 60 translations by a team of domain specialists. On the previously translated expository text, LLMs achieved high translation quality (mean MQM score 95.2/100), with performance approaching expert level. On the untranslated pharmacological text, aggregate quality was lower (79.9/100) but with high variance driven by two passages presenting extreme terminological density; excluding these, scores converged to within 4 points of the translated text. Terminology rarity, operationalized via corpus frequency in the literary Diorisis Ancient Greek Corpus, emerged as a strong predictor of translation failure (r = -.97 for passage-level quality on the untranslated text). Automated metrics showed moderate correlation with human judgment overall on the text with a wide quality spread (Composition), but no metric discriminated among high-quality translations. We discuss implications for the use of LLMs in Classical scholarship and for the design of automated evaluation pipelines for low-resource ancient languages."}

Process-reward methods like StepSearch alleviate this by introducing step-level supervision, but rely on heuristic rewards such as TF-IDF overlap with gold documents, and still sample k complete trajectories per example, retaining high gradient variance. We propose SLATE, a framework built on two complementary ideas: (1) truncated step-level sampling, which generates k trajectories that share a common prefix and differ only at the next step, and (2) dense LLM-as-judge rewards, which replace heuristic scoring with a capable LLM evaluator that assesses the quality of each reasoning step, search query, and answer, providing richer and more reliable supervision. We theoretically prove that under the same dense reward structure, truncated sampling reduces the variance of advantage estimates by up to a factor of T compared to full-trajectory sampling for T-step trajectories, yielding lower-variance, better-targeted policy gradients. Experiments on seven QA benchmarks confirm that SLATE consistently outperforms both sparse-reward and process-reward baselines, with the largest gains on harder multi-hop tasks and smaller models."}

To improve retrieval of coordinates from similar digitized early modern texts, we have created a gold standard dataset, trained models, published the resulting inferred and normalized coordinate data, and experimented applying these models to new texts. From 74,000 total articles in each of the digitized versions of the Encyclopedie from ARTFL and ENCCRE, we examined 15,278 geographical entries, manually identifying 4,798 containing coordinates, and 10,480 with descriptive but non-numerical references.

This enables an interactive scaling analysis, in which a fixed token budget is divided over a variable number of turns. We find that in many cases, language models are unable to use interactive collaboration to improve over the non-interactive baseline scenario in which one agent attempts to summarize its information and the other agent immediately acts -- despite substantial headroom. This suggests that state-of-the-art models still suffer from significant weaknesses in planning and executing multi-turn collaborative conversations. We analyze the linguistic features of these dialogues, assessing the roles of sycophancy, information density, and discourse coherence. While there is no single linguistic explanation for the collaborative weaknesses of contemporary language models, we note that humans achieve comparable task success at superior token efficiency by producing dialogues that are more coherent than those produced by most language models. The proactive management of private information is a defining feature of real-world communication, and we hope that MT-PingEval will drive further work towards improving this capability."}

However, their reasoning traces are difficult to control, which can result in the unintended leakage of private information to external parties. We propose training models to follow instructions not only in the final answer, but also in reasoning traces, potentially under different constraints. We hypothesize that improving their instruction following abilities in the reasoning traces can improve their privacy-preservation skills. To demonstrate this, we fine-tune models on a new instruction-following dataset with explicit restrictions on reasoning traces. We further introduce a generation strategy that decouples reasoning and answer generation using separate LoRA adapters. We evaluate our approach on six models from two model families, ranging from 1.7B to 14B parameters, across two instruction-following benchmarks and two privacy benchmarks. Our method yields substantial improvements, achieving gains of up to 20.9 points in instruction-following performance and up to 51.9 percentage points on privacy benchmarks. These improvements, however, can come at the cost of task utility, due to the trade-off between reasoning performance and instruction-following abilities. Overall, our results show that improving instruction-following behavior in reasoning models can significantly enhance privacy, suggesting a promising direction for the development of future privacy-aware agents.

In this work, we revisit this design choice by asking whether large language models benefit from conditioning on their own prior responses. Using in-the-wild, multi-turn conversations, we compare standard (full-context) prompting with a user-turn-only prompting approach that omits all previous assistant responses, across three open reasoning models and one state-of-the-art model. To our surprise, we find that removing prior assistant responses does not affect response quality on a large fraction of turns. Omitting assistant-side history can reduce cumulative context lengths by up to 10x. To explain this result, we find that multi-turn conversations consist of a substantial proportion (36.4%) of self-contained prompts, and that many follow-up prompts provide sufficient instruction to be answered using only the current user turn and prior user turns. When analyzing cases where user-turn-only prompting substantially outperforms full context, we identify instances of context pollution, in which models over-condition on their previous responses, introducing errors, hallucinations, or stylistic artifacts that propagate across turns. Motivated by these findings, we design a context-filtering approach that selectively omits assistant-side context. Our findings suggest that selectively omitting assistant history can improve response quality while reducing memory consumption."}

Recent work, Think-Then-Embed (TTE), shows that incorporating multimodal reasoning to elicit additional informative tokens before embedding can further improve retrieval. In this paper, we extend this paradigm with TTE-v2, a hybrid multimodal retrieval framework that introduces reasoning-driven performance scaling based on additional input token budget rather than model or embedding size. Our approach augments the initial multimodal retrieval with additional reasoning steps for reranking, enabling more expressive query-candidate interactions at test time. The reranking stage further provides fine-grained supervision for hard negative mining and false negative filtering, creating a feedback loop that effectively strengthens the upstream retriever. This cascaded design delivers substantial test-time improvements based on intermediate reasoning token scaling. Experiments on the MMEB-V2 benchmark demonstrate that TTE-v2-7B achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 75.7%, and that TTE-v2-2B matches or surpasses leading 7B models trained with significantly larger external data.

Recent retrieval augmented generation (RAG) approaches improve grounding but struggle with multi-hop reasoning, citation chaining, and cross-domain dependencies inherent to legal texts.\n  We propose a domain partitioned hybrid RAG and Knowledge Graph architecture designed specifically for Indian legal research. The system integrates three specialized RAG pipelines covering Supreme Court case law, statutory and constitutional texts, and the Indian Penal Code, each optimized for domain specific retrieval. To enable relational reasoning beyond semantic similarity, we construct a Neo4j based Legal Knowledge Graph capturing structured relationships among cases, statutes, IPC sections, judges, and citations. An LLM driven agentic orchestrator dynamically routes queries across retrieval modules and the knowledge graph, fusing evidence into grounded and citation aware responses.\n  We evaluate the system using a 40 question synthetic legal question answer benchmark curated from authoritative Indian legal sources and assessed via an LLM as a Judge framework. Results show that the hybrid architecture achieves a 70 percent pass rate, substantially outperforming a RAG only baseline at 37.5 percent, with marked improvements in completeness and legal reasoning quality. These findings demonstrate that combining domain partitioned retrieval with structured relational knowledge provides a scalable and interpretable foundation for advanced legal AI systems in the Indian judicial context."}

We present SPRIG (Seeded Propagation for Retrieval In Graphs), a CPU-only, linear-time, token-free GraphRAG pipeline that replaces LLM graph building with lightweight NER-driven co-occurrence graphs and uses Personalized PageRank (PPR) for 28% with negligible Recall@10 changes. The results characterize when CPU-friendly graph retrieval helps multi-hop recall and when strong lexical hybrids (RRF) are sufficient, outlining a realistic path to democratizing GraphRAG without token costs or GPU requirements."}

However, the transition from proof-of-concept to production-grade RAG systems is hindered by three persistent challenges: low retrieval precision for complex queries, high rates of hallucination in the generation phase, and unacceptable latency for real-time applications. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the Higress RAG MCP Server, a novel, enterprise-centric architecture designed to resolve these bottlenecks through a \"Full-Link Optimization\" strategy. Built upon the Model Context Protocol (MCP), the system introduces a layered architecture that orchestrates a sophisticated pipeline of Adaptive Routing, Semantic Caching, Hybrid Retrieval, and Corrective RAG (CRAG). We detail the technical implementation of key innovations, including the Higress-Native Splitter for structure-aware data ingestion, the application of Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) for merging dense and sparse retrieval signals, and a 50ms-latency Semantic Caching mechanism with dynamic thresholding. Experimental evaluations on domain-specific Higress technical documentation and blogs verify the system's architectural robustness. The results demonstrate that by optimizing the entire retrieval lifecycle - from pre-retrieval query rewriting to post-retrieval corrective evaluation - the Higress RAG system offers a scalable, hallucination-resistant solution for enterprise AI deployment."}
