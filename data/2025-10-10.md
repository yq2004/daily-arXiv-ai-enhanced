### [1] [Inconsistent Affective Reaction: Sentiment of Perception and Opinion in Urban Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07359)
*Jingfei Huang,Han Tu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一种新颖的方法来识别和解释城市环境中的情感不一致性，通过整合街景图像和社交媒体文本数据，构建了感知与意见的情感反应指数，揭示了北京二环地区2016-2022年间感知与意见情感之间的显著差异及其与城市要素的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体的兴起改变了我们对城市环境的理解，产生了嵌入人类感知和意见中的情感反应细微变化，这对城市研究中现有的多维情感分析方法提出了挑战。

Method: 构建包含140,750张百度/腾讯街景图像（测量感知）和984,024条微博社交媒体文本（测量意见）的数据集；开发反应指数，整合目标检测和自然语言处理技术对北京二环2016和2022年的情感进行分类；使用回归分析、图像分割和基于土地利用分布的词频分析情感反应。

Result: 感知情感反应趋势图显示正向情感分布更加均匀，而意见情感反应趋势图显示更极端的变化；不匹配图显示人类感知与城市区域意见情感之间存在显著差异；情感反应变化与密集建筑和行人存在等要素有显著关系。

Conclusion: 不一致性地图展示了疫情前后的感知和意见情感，为环境管理和城市更新策略制定提供了潜在解释和方向。

Abstract: The ascension of social media platforms has transformed our understanding of
urban environments, giving rise to nuanced variations in sentiment reaction
embedded within human perception and opinion, and challenging existing
multidimensional sentiment analysis approaches in urban studies. This study
presents novel methodologies for identifying and elucidating sentiment
inconsistency, constructing a dataset encompassing 140,750 Baidu and Tencent
Street view images to measure perceptions, and 984,024 Weibo social media text
posts to measure opinions. A reaction index is developed, integrating object
detection and natural language processing techniques to classify sentiment in
Beijing Second Ring for 2016 and 2022. Classified sentiment reaction is
analysed and visualized using regression analysis, image segmentation, and word
frequency based on land-use distribution to discern underlying factors. The
perception affective reaction trend map reveals a shift toward more evenly
distributed positive sentiment, while the opinion affective reaction trend map
shows more extreme changes. Our mismatch map indicates significant disparities
between the sentiments of human perception and opinion of urban areas over the
years. Changes in sentiment reactions have significant relationships with
elements such as dense buildings and pedestrian presence. Our inconsistent maps
present perception and opinion sentiments before and after the pandemic and
offer potential explanations and directions for environmental management, in
formulating strategies for urban renewal.

### [2] [Haystack Engineering: Context Engineering for Heterogeneous and Agentic Long-Context Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07414)
*Mufei Li,Dongqi Fu,Limei Wang,Si Zhang,Hanqing Zeng,Kaan Sancak,Ruizhong Qiu,Haoyu Wang,Xiaoxin He,Xavier Bresson,Yinglong Xia,Chonglin Sun,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HaystackCraft是一个新的长上下文基准测试，通过模拟真实世界的噪声上下文（来自有偏检索和智能体工作流）来评估LLM的鲁棒性，发现即使先进模型在智能体测试中也会出现级联失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的"大海捞针"基准测试忽略了真实世界中噪声上下文的来源，如检索偏差和智能体工作流中的级联错误，需要构建更真实的测试环境。

Method: 基于英文维基百科超链接网络构建HaystackCraft基准，包含多跳问题，评估不同检索策略对干扰项构成的影响，并扩展到动态的智能体操作模拟。

Result: 实验表明：1）更强的密集检索器会引入更具挑战性的干扰项，但基于图的重新排序能同时提高检索效果并减轻有害干扰；2）在智能体测试中，即使先进模型也会因自生成干扰项而出现级联失败或难以早期停止。

Conclusion: 智能体长上下文推理仍面临持续挑战，HaystackCraft为未来进展提供了有价值的测试平台。

Abstract: Modern long-context large language models (LLMs) perform well on synthetic
"needle-in-a-haystack" (NIAH) benchmarks, but such tests overlook how noisy
contexts arise from biased retrieval and agentic workflows. We argue that
haystack engineering is necessary to construct noisy long contexts that
faithfully capture key real-world factors -- distraction from heterogeneous
biased retrievers and cascading errors in agentic workflows -- to test models'
long-context robustness. We instantiate it through HaystackCraft, a new NIAH
benchmark built on the full English Wikipedia hyperlink network with multi-hop
questions. HaystackCraft evaluates how heterogeneous retrieval strategies
(e.g., sparse, dense, hybrid, and graph-based) affect distractor composition,
haystack ordering, and downstream LLM performance. HaystackCraft further
extends NIAH to dynamic, LLM-dependent settings that simulate agentic
operations, where models refine queries, reflect on their past reasonings, and
decide when to stop. Experiments with 15 long-context models show that (1)
while stronger dense retrievers can introduce more challenging distractors,
graph-based reranking simultaneously improves retrieval effectiveness and
mitigates more harmful distractors; (2) in agentic tests, even advanced models
like Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 suffer cascading failures from self-generated
distractors or struggle to perform early stops. These results highlight
persistent challenges in agentic long-context reasoning and establish
HaystackCraft as a valuable testbed for future progress.

### [3] [Lemma Dilemma: On Lemma Generation Without Domain- or Language-Specific Training Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07434)
*Olia Toporkov,Alan Akbik,Rodrigo Agerri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文实证研究了大语言模型在上下文词形还原任务中的表现，发现在缺乏目标领域训练数据的情况下，LLMs通过少量示例的上下文学习即可达到最先进水平，优于传统的跨领域微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在多种NLP任务中表现出色，但它们在上下文词形还原任务中的有效性尚未得到验证。本研究旨在探索LLMs在该任务中的能力，特别是在目标领域或语言缺乏监督训练数据的情况下。

Method: 比较了两种方法：(i) 在域外微调的编码器监督方法，(ii) 跨语言方法，与(iii) LLMs直接通过上下文生成词形的能力。实验在12种不同形态复杂度的语言上进行。

Result: 实验发现，虽然编码器在域外微调时仍具竞争力，但当前LLMs在大多数语言中通过少量示例的上下文学习即可达到最先进结果，无需事先微调。

Conclusion: LLMs在缺乏目标领域训练数据的情况下，通过上下文学习能够有效执行词形还原任务，在大多数语言中超越了传统监督方法，展示了其在低资源场景下的强大潜力。

Abstract: Lemmatization is the task of transforming all words in a given text to their
dictionary forms. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
ability to achieve competitive results across a wide range of NLP tasks, there
is no prior evidence of how effective they are in the contextual lemmatization
task. In this paper, we empirically investigate the capacity of the latest
generation of LLMs to perform in-context lemmatization, comparing it to the
traditional fully supervised approach. In particular, we consider the setting
in which supervised training data is not available for a target domain or
language, comparing (i) encoder-only supervised approaches, fine-tuned
out-of-domain, and (ii) cross-lingual methods, against direct in-context lemma
generation with LLMs. Our experimental investigation across 12 languages of
different morphological complexity finds that, while encoders remain
competitive in out-of-domain settings when fine-tuned on gold data, current
LLMs reach state-of-the-art results for most languages by directly generating
lemmas in-context without prior fine-tuning, provided just with a few examples.

### [4] [LASER: An LLM-based ASR Scoring and Evaluation Rubric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07437)
*Amruta Parulekar,Preethi Jyothi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LASER是一个基于LLM的ASR评估指标，通过上下文学习来评估语音识别结果，相比传统WER指标能更好地处理形态和句法差异，在印地语上达到94%的人类标注相关性，并能泛化到其他印度语言。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的词错误率(WER)等ASR评估指标会不公平地惩罚那些不显著改变句子语义的形态和句法细微差异，需要更语义感知的评估方法。

Method: 利用最先进LLM的上下文学习能力，通过包含详细示例的提示来学习评分标准；同时展示了如何通过微调较小LLM（如Llama 3）来预测惩罚类型。

Result: 使用Gemini 2.5 Pro的印地语LASER评分与人类标注达到了94%的高相关性；印地语提示示例对其他印度语言（马拉地语、卡纳达语、马拉雅拉姆语）的错误分析也有效；微调后的Llama 3在预测惩罚类型上达到接近89%的准确率。

Conclusion: LLM-based的LASER评分方法能有效解决传统ASR评估指标的局限性，提供更语义感知的评估，并在多语言场景中展现出良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Standard ASR evaluation metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) tend to unfairly
penalize morphological and syntactic nuances that do not significantly alter
sentence semantics. We introduce an LLM-based scoring rubric LASER that
leverages state-of-the-art LLMs' in-context learning abilities to learn from
prompts with detailed examples. Hindi LASER scores using Gemini 2.5 Pro
achieved a very high correlation score of 94% with human annotations. Hindi
examples in the prompt were also effective in analyzing errors in other Indian
languages such as Marathi, Kannada and Malayalam. We also demonstrate how a
smaller LLM like Llama 3 can be finetuned on word-pair examples derived from
reference and ASR predictions to predict what kind of penalty should be applied
with close to 89% accuracy.

### [5] [Meaningful Pose-Based Sign Language Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07453)
*Zifan Jiang,Colin Leong,Amit Moryossef,Anne Göhring,Annette Rios,Oliver Cory,Maksym Ivashechkin,Neha Tarigopula,Biao Zhang,Rico Sennrich,Sarah Ebling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个全面的手语姿势评估研究，涵盖了基于关键点距离、嵌入和回译的评估指标，并通过自动元评估和人类相关性研究展示了不同指标在不同场景下的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏对手语姿势进行有意义评估的系统性方法，需要开发实用且可复现的评估工具来支持手语翻译或生成系统的开发。

Method: 使用基于关键点距离、嵌入和回译的评估指标，通过自动元评估（手语级别检索）和人类相关性研究（跨语言文本到姿势翻译）来分析不同指标的权衡。

Result: 研究揭示了不同评估指标在不同场景下的权衡关系，并开发了开源姿势评估工具包，为手语翻译系统的开发提供了实用评估方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为手语翻译和生成系统的开发提供了实用的评估框架和工具，通过系统性的指标分析支持了该领域的发展。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on meaningfully evaluating sign language
utterances in the form of human skeletal poses. The study covers keypoint
distance-based, embedding-based, and back-translation-based metrics. We show
tradeoffs between different metrics in different scenarios through automatic
meta-evaluation of sign-level retrieval and a human correlation study of
text-to-pose translation across different sign languages. Our findings and the
open-source pose-evaluation toolkit provide a practical and reproducible way of
developing and evaluating sign language translation or generation systems.

### [6] [Populism Meets AI: Advancing Populism Research with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07458)
*Eduardo Ryô Tamaki,Yujin J. Jung,Julia Chatterley,Grant Mitchell,Semir Dzebo,Cristóbal Sandoval,Levente Littvay,Kirk A. Hawkins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于规则和锚点引导的思维链提示方法，用于测量民粹主义的思想内容，该方法通过模仿人类编码员训练过程，使大语言模型能够达到与专家人类编码员相当的分类准确度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于文本分析的民粹主义测量方法成本高、耗时长且难以跨语言、跨语境和大规模语料库扩展，需要一种更高效、可扩展的替代方案。

Method: 使用全球民粹主义数据库（GPD），通过规则和锚点引导的思维链提示方法，将人类编码员训练文档改编后用于提示大语言模型，测试了多个专有和开源模型。

Result: 研究发现这种领域特定的提示策略使大语言模型能够达到与专家人类编码员相当的分类准确度，能够处理民粹主义的细微和语境敏感方面。

Conclusion: 基于规则和锚点引导的思维链提示方法为测量民粹主义思想内容提供了一种有效、可扩展的替代方案，能够复制人类编码员的判断过程。

Abstract: Measuring the ideational content of populism remains a challenge. Traditional
strategies based on textual analysis have been critical for building the
field's foundations and providing a valid, objective indicator of populist
framing. Yet these approaches are costly, time consuming, and difficult to
scale across languages, contexts, and large corpora. Here we present the
results from a rubric and anchor guided chain of thought (CoT) prompting
approach that mirrors human coder training. By leveraging the Global Populism
Database (GPD), a comprehensive dataset of global leaders' speeches annotated
for degrees of populism, we replicate the process used to train human coders by
prompting the LLM with an adapted version of the same documentation to guide
the model's reasoning. We then test multiple proprietary and open weight models
by replicating scores in the GPD. Our findings reveal that this domain specific
prompting strategy enables the LLM to achieve classification accuracy on par
with expert human coders, demonstrating its ability to navigate the nuanced,
context sensitive aspects of populism.

### [7] [MAPRO: Recasting Multi-Agent Prompt Optimization as Maximum a Posteriori Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07475)
*Zheyuan Zhang,Lin Ge,Hongjiang Li,Weicheng Zhu,Chuxu Zhang,Yanfang Ye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAPRO是一个用于多智能体系统提示优化的框架，通过将提示优化建模为最大后验概率推断问题，使用语言引导的置信传播算法和拓扑感知的细化机制来迭代优化智能体提示，在多任务基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统虽然能超越单智能体性能，但由于提示敏感性和系统不稳定性，设计有效的多智能体系统仍然困难。现有的自动提示设计方法主要关注单智能体，多智能体提示优化仍未被充分探索。

Method: MAPRO是一个四阶段框架：1）将多智能体提示优化建模为最大后验概率推断问题；2）使用语言引导的max-product置信传播算法求解；3）采用拓扑感知的细化机制，整合执行反馈和下游责任来选择性更新智能体提示；4）迭代收敛到协调的智能体特定提示策略。

Result: 在各种任务的基准测试中，MAPRO实现了最先进的性能，持续超越手动设计的基线和最近的自动替代方案。

Conclusion: MAPRO不仅提供了性能优势，其基于最大后验概率的公式化还为构建更可靠和原则化的多智能体系统提供了通用指导原则。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse tasks, and LLM-based agents further extend these abilities to various
practical workflows. While recent progress shows that multi-agent systems (MAS)
can outperform single agents by coordinating specialized roles, designing
effective MAS remains difficult due to prompt sensitivity and the compounded
instability MAS creates. To cope with the challenge, recent efforts in
automated prompt design have reduced manual effort. However, multi-agent prompt
optimization remains largely unexplored. Challenges like exponentially
expanding search space and ambiguous credit assignment together make systematic
design intractable without principled methods. Therefore, we introduce
M}ulti-Agent PRompt Optimization (MAPRO), a four-stage framework that first
formulates MAS prompt optimization as a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference
problem and solves it using a language-guided variant of max-product belief
propagation algorithm. To address credit assignment and updates the system
iteratively, MAPRO employs a topology-aware refinement mechanism that
integrates execution feedback and downstream blames to selectively update agent
prompts. Through this process, MAPRO progressively converges to a coordinated
set of agent-specific prompt policies. Across benchmarks in various tasks,
MAPRO achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpassing manually
engineered baselines and recent automated alternatives. Beyond performance, our
MAP-based formulation also delivers general guidelines for building more
reliable and principled multi-agent systems in the future

### [8] [AsyncSpade: Efficient Test-Time Scaling with Asynchronous Sparse Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07486)
*Shuqing Luo,Yilin Guan,Pingzhi Li,Hanrui Wang,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AsyncSpade是一个异步框架，通过预测查询状态和分离KV缓存过滤与解码循环，显著提升测试时扩展（TTS）场景下LLM推理效率，在保持精度的同时减少50%以上的时间开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有查询感知的稀疏解码方法在TTS任务中面临两个主要问题：顺序依赖的页面过滤和粗粒度的令牌选择，这在高并发和长思维链场景下会显著降低服务效率，甚至比前向推理本身消耗更多时间。

Method: AsyncSpade包含两个核心组件：(1) 轻量级时间回归模块，预测下一个令牌的查询状态；(2) 异步解耦框架，将KV缓存过滤与自回归解码循环分离，通过异步机制将令牌级KV选择与前向推理计算重叠。

Result: 在A100节点上的实验表明，AsyncSpade完全重叠了KV缓存操作与推理流水线，实现了理论最优的每输出令牌时间（TPOT）。相比最先进基线Quest减少超过20%的TPOT，相比全注意力机制减少至少50%的TPOT，同时在多个TTS基准测试上保持或超越了模型精度。

Conclusion: AsyncSpade是首个在不牺牲模型性能的前提下消除顺序依赖的方法，为TTS场景下的高效LLM服务提供了有效的解决方案，显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) boosts LLM reasoning via long chain-of-thought (CoT),
but the linear KV-cache growth amplifies the memory-bound bottleneck of LLM
decoding. Query-aware page-level sparse decoding can achieve state-of-the-art
performance under constrained FLOPs budgets, but is limited by both
sequential-dependent page filtering and coarse-grained token selection,
hampering serving efficiency and model performance on TTS tasks under high
concurrency and long CoT scenarios (consuming even higher runtime than the
forward pipeline itself). In this paper, we first find that the current-step
query state can be accurately approximated in a unified manner from a short
window of recent queries, enabling training-free query-aware sparsity without
waiting in the decoding loop. We propose AsyncSpade, an asynchronous framework
for efficient TTS built on two core components: (1) a novel light-weight
temporal-regressive module that predicts the next-token query state; (2) an
asynchronous and disaggregated framework that decouples the KV cache filtering
from the auto-regressive decoding loop, overlapping the token-level KV
selection with the forward inference computation through asynchronism. To our
knowledge, AsyncSpade is the first to eliminate the sequential dependence
without sacrificing model performance. We validate the effectiveness of
AsyncSpade on common LLM serving setups with an A100 node, where AsyncSpade
fully overlaps KV-cache operations with the inference pipeline, achieving
theoretical optimal time-per-output-token (TPOT). Specifically, AsyncSpade
delivers over 20% reduction on TPOT compared to SoTA baseline (i.e. Quest) and
at least 50% TPOT reduction compared to full attention on Qwen3-8B and
Qwen3-32B models, while matching or surpassing their accuracy on various TTS
benchmarks (AIME-24/25, GPQA-Diamond, MATH-500).

### [9] [Can Lessons From Human Teams Be Applied to Multi-Agent Systems? The Role of Structure, Diversity, and Interaction Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07488)
*Rasika Muralidharan,Jaewoon Kwak,Jisun An*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个多智能体框架来探索团队科学的核心方面（结构、多样性和互动动态），并在四个任务上评估团队表现，发现扁平团队表现优于层级团队，多样性影响复杂，智能体对团队表现过度自信但反思中显示出协作价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然基于大语言模型的多智能体系统受到关注，但对其团队动态的研究较少，受人类团队科学启发，探索智能体团队的结构、多样性和互动动态。

Method: 提出多智能体框架，在CommonsenseQA、StrategyQA、Social IQa和Latent Implicit Hate四个任务上评估团队表现，涵盖常识推理和社会推理。

Result: 扁平团队表现优于层级团队，多样性影响复杂；访谈显示智能体对团队表现过度自信，但任务后反思显示出对协作的欣赏以及整合挑战（包括有限的对话协调）。

Conclusion: 多智能体团队的结构和互动动态对性能有重要影响，扁平结构更有效，智能体在协作中面临整合挑战，但认识到协作的价值。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) with Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents are
gaining attention, yet fewer studies explore their team dynamics. Inspired by
human team science, we propose a multi-agent framework to examine core aspects
of team science: structure, diversity, and interaction dynamics. We evaluate
team performance across four tasks: CommonsenseQA, StrategyQA, Social IQa, and
Latent Implicit Hate, spanning commonsense and social reasoning. Our results
show that flat teams tend to perform better than hierarchical ones, while
diversity has a nuanced impact. Interviews suggest agents are overconfident
about their team performance, yet post-task reflections reveal both
appreciation for collaboration and challenges in integration, including limited
conversational coordination.

TL;DR: Summary generation failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent advances in speech large language models (speech LLMs) have enabled
seamless spoken interactions, but these systems still struggle with complex
reasoning tasks. Previously, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuning
has been to shown to significantly improve the reasoning abilities of
text-based LLMs. In this work, we investigate the effect of CoT fine-tuning for
multi-stream speech LLMs, demonstrating that reasoning in text space improves
the accuracy of speech LLMs by 2.4x, on average, over a suite of spoken
reasoning tasks. Beyond accuracy, the latency of the spoken response is a
crucial factor for interacting with voice-based agents. Inspired by the human
behavior of "thinking while listening," we propose methods to reduce the
additional latency from reasoning by allowing the model to start reasoning
before the user query has ended. To achieve this, we introduce an entropy-based
metric, "question completeness," which acts as an indicator to guide the model
on the optimal time to start reasoning. This method provides greater control
over the accuracy-latency trade-off compared with heuristic-based approaches
and, under equivalent latency conditions, yields a 4% accuracy gain on
ARC-Easy. Finally, we use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on preference
data created using rejection sampling to push the accuracy-latency pareto
frontier further, resulting in a 70% reduction in latency without loss in
accuracy.

### [11] [When Thoughts Meet Facts: Reusable Reasoning for Long-Context LMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07499)
*Soyeong Jeong,Taehee Jung,Sung Ju Hwang,Joo-Kyung Kim,Dongyeop Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Thought Template Augmented LCLMs (ToTAL)框架，通过可重用的思维模板来指导长上下文语言模型进行多跳推理，解决了简单增加文档数量无法有效连接证据的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前长上下文语言模型虽然能处理大量token，但简单将更多文档输入上下文窗口无法有效捕获证据之间的连接方式，限制了知识密集型多跳推理的能力。

Method: 使用思维模板将推理重新表述为可重用的思维缓存，这些模板源自先前的问题解决轨迹，用于结构化证据组合并指导多跳推理。通过基于自然语言反馈的迭代更新策略来保持模板的有效性。

Result: 在多样化基准测试和不同LCLM家族中，该方法在基于检索和无检索设置下均优于强基线模型。优化后的模板还能蒸馏到更小的开源模型中，展示了广泛的适用性和透明的推理重用。

Conclusion: ToTAL框架通过思维模板有效提升了长上下文语言模型的多跳推理能力，实现了推理过程的透明重用，并具有良好的可迁移性。

Abstract: Recent Long-Context Language Models (LCLMs) can process hundreds of thousands
of tokens in a single prompt, enabling new opportunities for
knowledge-intensive multi-hop reasoning by integrating large sets of retrieved
documents or, in some cases, directly all necessary information. However,
simply feeding more documents into the context window fails to capture how
evidence should be connected. We address this gap with thought templates, which
recast reasoning as reusable thought caches, derived from prior problem solving
traces, structuring how evidence is combined and guiding multi-hop inference
with factual documents. To keep these templates effective, we propose an update
strategy that iteratively refines templates derived from training data through
natural-language feedback. Across diverse benchmarks and LCLM families, our
approach delivers consistent gains over strong baselines in both
retrieval-based and retrieval-free settings. Furthermore, we show that
optimized templates can be distilled into smaller open-source models,
demonstrating its broad applicability and transparent reasoning reuse. We refer
to our framework as Thought Template Augmented LCLMs (ToTAL).

### [12] [ParsTranslit: Truly Versatile Tajik-Farsi Transliteration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07520)
*Rayyan Merchant,Kevin Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的波斯语-塔吉克语双向音译模型，通过整合所有可用数据集并创建两个新数据集，实现了跨领域的先进音译性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 波斯语作为双语种语言，在阿富汗和伊朗使用波斯-阿拉伯文字，在塔吉克斯坦使用塔吉克-西里尔文字。尽管各国方言相似，但文字差异阻碍了塔吉克斯坦与其他波斯语国家之间的书面交流。现有音译模型大多局限于特定领域文本，缺乏实际应用的通用性。

Method: 开发了一个新的最先进的序列到序列模型，用于塔吉克-波斯语双向音译，整合了所有可用数据集，并创建了两个新数据集进行训练。

Result: 模型在Farsi到Tajik方向上实现了chrF++ 87.91和标准化CER 0.05的得分，在Tajik到Farsi方向上实现了chrF++ 92.28和标准化CER 0.04的得分，设定了全面的可比基准。

Conclusion: 该模型通过跨领域训练提供了对音译任务更清晰的理解，并建立了领先的基准。模型、数据和代码均已公开可用。

Abstract: As a digraphic language, the Persian language utilizes two written standards:
Perso-Arabic in Afghanistan and Iran, and Tajik-Cyrillic in Tajikistan. Despite
the significant similarity between the dialects of each country, script
differences prevent simple one-to-one mapping, hindering written communication
and interaction between Tajikistan and its Persian-speaking ``siblings''. To
overcome this, previously-published efforts have investigated machine
transliteration models to convert between the two scripts. Unfortunately, most
efforts did not use datasets other than those they created, limiting these
models to certain domains of text such as archaic poetry or word lists. A truly
usable transliteration system must be capable of handling varied domains,
meaning that suck models lack the versatility required for real-world usage.
The contrast in domain between data also obscures the task's true difficulty.
We present a new state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence model for Tajik-Farsi
transliteration trained across all available datasets, and present two datasets
of our own. Our results across domains provide clearer understanding of the
task, and set comprehensive comparable leading benchmarks. Overall, our model
achieves chrF++ and Normalized CER scores of 87.91 and 0.05 from Farsi to Tajik
and 92.28 and 0.04 from Tajik to Farsi. Our model, data, and code are available
at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ParsTranslit-FB30/.

### [13] [OWL: Overcoming Window Length-Dependence in Speculative Decoding for Long-Context Inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07535)
*Jaeseong Lee,seung-won hwang,Aurick Qiao,Gabriele Oliaro,Ye Wang,Samyam Rajbhandari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了OWL模型，通过LSTM-based drafter、特殊token [SPEC]和混合解码算法，在长上下文场景下实现比EAGLE3高5倍的接受长度，解决了现有推测解码方法在长上下文下性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推测解码方法在短上下文（如2K tokens）基准测试中表现良好，但在实际长上下文工作负载中性能严重下降，例如EAGLE3甚至会使生成速度降低0.81倍。

Method: 1) 基于LSTM的drafter，仅基于最后一个token状态进行条件化，使其能够泛化到各种长度；2) 在验证器中引入特殊token [SPEC]，为drafter生成更丰富的表示；3) 结合树和非树解码方法的混合算法。

Result: OWL在长上下文输入上实现了比EAGLE3高约5倍的接受长度，显著提升了长上下文场景下的推测解码性能。

Conclusion: 通过发布新的长上下文基准测试（LongSpecBench）和提出OWL模型，解决了现有推测解码方法在长上下文场景下的局限性，为未来研究提供了代码和数据集。

Abstract: Speculative decoding promises faster inference for large language models
(LLMs), yet existing methods fail to generalize to real-world settings.
Benchmarks typically assume short contexts (e.g., 2K tokens), whereas practical
workloads involve long contexts. We find current approaches degrade severely
with long contexts; for instance, EAGLE3 even slows down the generation speed
by 0.81x. We address these limitations by releasing a new long-context
benchmark (LongSpecBench) and introducing a novel model (OWL). OWL achieves
about 5x higher acceptance length than EAGLE3 on long-context inputs through
three innovations: (1) an LSTM-based drafter conditioned only on the last-token
state, making it generalize to various lengths, (2) a special token [SPEC] in
the verifier that produces richer representation for drafter, and (3) a hybrid
algorithm combining both tree and non-tree decoding methods. We release all
code and datasets to advance future research.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了两种方法（多标准提示和领域自适应迁移学习）来提升小型视觉语言模型（≤2B参数）在图表理解任务中作为自动评判器的性能，创建了ChartJudge模型，并在模型大小、提示设计和可迁移性之间提供了权衡分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（7B参数）在图表理解任务中作为自动评判器表现良好，但小型模型（≤2B参数）表现较差，限制了在资源受限环境中的实际应用。

Method: 提出了两种方法：(i) 多标准提示，将多个评估标准合并到单个查询中；(ii) 领域自适应迁移学习，在图表数据集上使用合成判断微调2B参数的LVLM来创建ChartJudge。

Result: 多标准提示暴露了鲁棒性差距，导致7B模型性能大幅下降；ChartJudge能够有效在不同数据集间迁移知识，成为更专业化的模型。

Conclusion: 通过模型大小、提示设计和可迁移性之间的权衡分析，为图表推理任务提供了可扩展、低成本的评估解决方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with only 7B parameters have shown
promise as automated judges in chart comprehension tasks. However, tiny models
(<=2B parameters) still perform poorly as judges, limiting their real-world use
in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose two approaches to
ensure cost-efficient evaluation: (i) multi-criteria prompting, which combines
separate evaluation criteria into a single query, and (ii) domain-adaptive
transfer learning, in which we fine-tune a 2B-parameter LVLM on synthetic
judgments in a chart dataset to create the ChartJudge. Experiments show that
multi-criteria prompting exposes robustness gaps, which led to a huge drop in
performance for 7B models, including specialized LVLM judges like LLaVA-Critic.
In addition, we find that our tiny LVLM (ChartJudge) can effectively transfer
knowledge from one dataset to another to make it a more specialized model. Our
fine-grained analysis across chart types and query complexities offers
actionable insights into trade-offs between model size, prompt design, and
transferability, enabling scalable, low-cost evaluation for chart reasoning
tasks. Our code and the data will be made publicly available.

*Junyi Zhu,Savas Ozkan,Andrea Maracani,Sinan Mutlu,Cho Jung Min,Mete Ozay*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于任务主LoRA模块的多任务预微调框架，使单个共享编码器骨干能够通过模块化适配器适应不同NLP任务，在移动部署约束下实现与单独预微调相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在移动平台上部署NLP模型需要能够适应多样化应用同时保持内存和计算效率的模型。研究预微调策略以增强轻量级BERT类编码器在命名实体识别和文本分类两个基本NLP任务家族中的适应性。

Method: 提出基于任务主LoRA模块的多任务预微调框架，使用单个共享编码器骨干与模块化适配器，解决朴素多任务预微调中优化信号冲突的问题。

Result: 在21个下游任务上的实验显示，NER任务平均提升+0.8%，文本分类任务平均提升+8.8%，证明了该方法在通用移动NLP应用中的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的多任务预微调框架能够在满足实际部署约束的同时，实现与单独预微调相当的性能，为移动NLP应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Deploying natural language processing (NLP) models on mobile platforms
requires models that can adapt across diverse applications while remaining
efficient in memory and computation. We investigate pre-finetuning strategies
to enhance the adaptability of lightweight BERT-like encoders for two
fundamental NLP task families: named entity recognition (NER) and text
classification. While pre-finetuning improves downstream performance for each
task family individually, we find that na\"ive multi-task pre-finetuning
introduces conflicting optimization signals that degrade overall performance.
To address this, we propose a simple yet effective multi-task pre-finetuning
framework based on task-primary LoRA modules, which enables a single shared
encoder backbone with modular adapters. Our approach achieves performance
comparable to individual pre-finetuning while meeting practical deployment
constraint. Experiments on 21 downstream tasks show average improvements of
+0.8% for NER and +8.8% for text classification, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our method for versatile mobile NLP applications.

*Mkululi Sikosana,Sean Maudsley-Barton,Oluwaseun Ajao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过计算语言学分析发现，COVID-19健康错误信息在语言特征上与事实性内容存在显著差异：可读性更低、恐惧相关词汇频率是其他内容的两倍以上、感叹号使用极少，采用复杂修辞风格结合情感暗示的策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在识别健康错误信息与事实性沟通在语言特征上的差异，以帮助检测错误信息并改进公共卫生信息策略。

Method: 使用三个语料库进行对比分析：COVID-19错误叙述语料库（7588条）、一般COVID-19内容语料库（10700条）和猴痘相关帖子语料库（5787条），分析可读性、修辞标记和说服性语言使用的差异。

Result: COVID-19错误信息表现出显著更低的可读性分数，恐惧相关或说服性术语频率是其他数据集的两倍以上，感叹号使用极少，与猴痘内容更具情感化的风格形成对比。

Conclusion: 错误信息采用故意复杂的修辞风格结合情感暗示，这种组合可能增强其感知可信度。研究为数字健康错误信息检测提供了语言指标，但也承认了传统可读性指数、有限说服词汇和静态聚合分析等局限性。

Abstract: This study conducts a computational linguistic analysis of pandemic-related
online discourse to examine how language distinguishes health misinformation
from factual communication. Drawing on three corpora: COVID-19 false narratives
(n = 7588), general COVID-19 content (n = 10700), and Monkeypox-related posts
(n = 5787), we identify significant differences in readability, rhetorical
markers, and persuasive language use. COVID-19 misinformation exhibited
markedly lower readability scores and contained over twice the frequency of
fear-related or persuasive terms compared to the other datasets. It also showed
minimal use of exclamation marks, contrasting with the more emotive style of
Monkeypox content. These patterns suggest that misinformation employs a
deliberately complex rhetorical style embedded with emotional cues, a
combination that may enhance its perceived credibility. Our findings contribute
to the growing body of work on digital health misinformation by highlighting
linguistic indicators that may aid detection efforts. They also inform public
health messaging strategies and theoretical models of crisis communication in
networked media environments. At the same time, the study acknowledges
limitations, including reliance on traditional readability indices, use of a
deliberately narrow persuasive lexicon, and reliance on static aggregate
analysis. Future research should therefore incorporate longitudinal designs,
broader emotion lexicons, and platform-sensitive approaches to strengthen
robustness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用LLMs作为工具开发构造语言的系统，通过模块化流程创建语音学、形态句法标记、词典、正字法和语法手册，并能翻译句子到目标语言。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 一是为构造人工语言提供有趣工具，二是探索LLMs对语言和语言学概念的理解程度，以及应用于从高资源语言到低资源语言的翻译。

Method: 模块化系统：1) 代理方法创建目标语音学；2) 将英语句子'翻译'为形态句法标记；3) 从翻译语料构建词典；4) 创建正字法；5) 编写语法手册。

Result: 不同LLMs和语言规范间能力差异较大，处理常见模式比罕见模式更容易。在低资源语言翻译方面结果多为负面，但改进版本可能有实际收益。

Conclusion: 该系统展示了LLMs在构造语言方面的应用潜力，揭示了LLMs对语言概念理解的局限性，并为低资源语言翻译提供了改进方向。

Abstract: We present a system that uses LLMs as a tool in the development of
Constructed Languages. The system is modular in that one first creates a target
phonology for the language using an agentic approach that refines its output at
each step with commentary feedback on its previous attempt. Next, a set of
sentences is 'translated' from their English original into a morphosyntactic
markup that reflects the word order and morphosyntactic feature specifications
of the desired target language, with affixes represented as morphosyntactic
feature bundles. From this translated corpus, a lexicon is constructed using
the phonological model and the set of morphemes (stems and affixes) extracted
from the 'translated' sentences. The system is then instructed to provide an
orthography for the language, using an existing script such as Latin or
Cyrillic. Finally, the system writes a brief grammatical handbook of the
language. The system can also translate further sentences into the target
language.
  Our goal is twofold. First, we hope that these tools will be fun to use for
creating artificially constructed languages. Second, we are interested in
exploring what LLMs 'know' about language-not what they know about any
particular language or linguistic phenomenon, but how much they know about and
understand language and linguistic concepts. As we shall see, there is a fairly
wide gulf in capabilities both among different LLMs and among different
linguistic specifications, with it being notably easier for systems to deal
with more common patterns than rarer ones. An additional avenue that we explore
is the application of our approach to translating from high-resource into
low-resource languages. While the results so far are mostly negative, we
provide some evidence that an improved version of the present system could
afford some real gains in such tasks.

*Isabel Papadimitriou,Jacob Prince*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究分析了语言模型输入词汇表示的结构及其在训练过程中的演变，发现词汇嵌入几何快速收敛到语义和句法特征，高频词和功能词比低频词收敛更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型输入词汇表示的结构如何形成以及在训练过程中如何演变，以理解词汇嵌入几何与语言结构的关系。

Method: 使用表征相似性分析，关联Pythia 12B和OLMo 7B两个开源模型的输入和输出嵌入几何结构与语义、句法和频率指标在训练过程中的相关性。

Result: 1) 词汇嵌入几何在训练过程中快速收敛到与语义和句法特征的高度相关性；2) 高频词和功能词比词汇词和低频词更快收敛到最终向量。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了词汇几何围绕语言结构组织的动态轨迹，显示了词频和功能的不同作用，为研究词汇几何演变如何促进模型特定能力提升提供了动机。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) work by manipulating the geometry of input
embedding vectors over multiple layers. Here, we ask: how are the input
vocabulary representations of language models structured, and how and when does
this structure evolve over training? To answer this question, we use
representational similarity analysis, running a suite of experiments that
correlate the geometric structure of the input embeddings and output embeddings
of two open-source models (Pythia 12B and OLMo 7B) with semantic, syntactic,
and frequency-based metrics over the course of training. Our key findings are
as follows: 1) During training, the vocabulary embedding geometry quickly
converges to high correlations with a suite of semantic and syntactic features;
2) Embeddings of high-frequency and function words (e.g., "the," "of") converge
to their final vectors faster than lexical and low-frequency words, which
retain some alignment with the bias in their random initializations. These
findings help map the dynamic trajectory by which input embeddings organize
around linguistic structure, revealing distinct roles for word frequency and
function. Our findings motivate a deeper study of how the evolution of
vocabulary geometry may facilitate specific capability gains during model
training.

TL;DR: LLMs在临床编码任务中表现不佳，特别是存在层次结构接近但错误的预测。通过轻量级干预和引入临床编码验证任务，可以显著提高准确性，并发布了门诊临床笔记的专家双标注基准数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在临床编码任务中表现不佳，传统基于精确匹配的评估方法忽略了层次结构接近但错误的预测问题，这些错误占据了LLM失败的大部分。

Method: 采用轻量级干预策略，包括提示工程和小规模微调，避免计算密集的基于搜索的方法。引入临床编码验证作为独立任务和流水线组件，并创建了专家双标注的门诊临床笔记基准数据集。

Result: 验证被证明是提高基于LLM的医疗编码有效且可靠的步骤，能够显著改善编码准确性，特别是针对层次结构接近的错误预测。

Conclusion: 临床编码验证是改进LLM在医疗编码任务中性能的关键方法，通过轻量级干预和专门的验证机制可以显著提高准确性，而无需依赖计算密集型方法。

Abstract: Accurate clinical coding is essential for healthcare documentation, billing,
and decision-making. While prior work shows that off-the-shelf LLMs struggle
with this task, evaluations based on exact match metrics often overlook errors
where predicted codes are hierarchically close but incorrect. Our analysis
reveals that such hierarchical misalignments account for a substantial portion
of LLM failures. We show that lightweight interventions, including prompt
engineering and small-scale fine-tuning, can improve accuracy without the
computational overhead of search-based methods. To address hierarchically
near-miss errors, we introduce clinical code verification as both a standalone
task and a pipeline component. To mitigate the limitations in existing
datasets, such as incomplete evidence and inpatient bias in MIMIC, we release
an expert double-annotated benchmark of outpatient clinical notes with ICD-10
codes. Our results highlight verification as an effective and reliable step
toward improving LLM-based medical coding.

*Đorđe Klisura,Joseph Khoury,Ashish Kundu,Ram Krishnan,Anthony Rios*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在角色条件拒绝方面的能力，通过创建基于Spider和BIRD数据集的新数据集，比较了三种方法在SQL查询访问控制策略下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 访问控制是安全计算的基础，但大型语言模型经常通过产生不受限制的响应来模糊角色边界。需要研究LLM在授权时回答、未授权时拒绝的能力。

Method: 比较了三种设计：(i) 零样本或少样本提示；(ii) 两步生成器-验证器管道，检查SQL是否符合策略；(iii) LoRA微调模型直接学习权限感知。

Result: 显式验证（两步框架）提高了拒绝精度并降低了错误许可率，同时微调在安全性和实用性之间实现了更好的平衡。更长更复杂的策略会降低所有系统的可靠性。

Conclusion: 显式验证方法在访问控制方面表现更好，而微调方法在安全性和实用性之间达到最佳平衡。复杂策略会降低系统可靠性。

Abstract: Access control is a cornerstone of secure computing, yet large language
models often blur role boundaries by producing unrestricted responses. We study
role-conditioned refusals, focusing on the LLM's ability to adhere to access
control policies by answering when authorized and refusing when not. To
evaluate this behavior, we created a novel dataset that extends the Spider and
BIRD text-to-SQL datasets, both of which have been modified with realistic
PostgreSQL role-based policies at the table and column levels. We compare three
designs: (i) zero or few-shot prompting, (ii) a two-step generator-verifier
pipeline that checks SQL against policy, and (iii) LoRA fine-tuned models that
learn permission awareness directly. Across multiple model families, explicit
verification (the two-step framework) improves refusal precision and lowers
false permits. At the same time, fine-tuning achieves a stronger balance
between safety and utility (i.e., when considering execution accuracy). Longer
and more complex policies consistently reduce the reliability of all systems.
We release RBAC-augmented datasets and code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统银行助手仅限于咨询或支持角色，无法作为主要银行界面执行核心金融交易。需要开发一个监管机构批准的、可靠的对话式AI系统来替代复杂的多屏工作流程。

Method: 使用内部开发的闭源LLM ILMU，通过四个LLM驱动的智能体（护栏、意图、支付、FAQ）协调单一对话，每个智能体使用任务特定的LoRA适配器，在银行基础设施内托管以确保一致性。

Result: 成功实现了监管机构批准的自然语言界面，能够可靠地在严格治理下支持核心金融操作，展示了对话式AI作为主要银行界面的可行性。

Conclusion: Ryt AI证明了在严格监管环境下，自然语言界面可以可靠地支持核心金融操作，代表了银行服务向更直观、高效对话式体验的转变。

Abstract: This paper presents Ryt AI, an LLM-native agentic framework that powers Ryt
Bank to enable customers to execute core financial transactions through natural
language conversation. This represents the first global regulator-approved
deployment worldwide where conversational AI functions as the primary banking
interface, in contrast to prior assistants that have been limited to advisory
or support roles. Built entirely in-house, Ryt AI is powered by ILMU, a
closed-source LLM developed internally, and replaces rigid multi-screen
workflows with a single dialogue orchestrated by four LLM-powered agents
(Guardrails, Intent, Payment, and FAQ). Each agent attaches a task-specific
LoRA adapter to ILMU, which is hosted within the bank's infrastructure to
ensure consistent behavior with minimal overhead. Deterministic guardrails,
human-in-the-loop confirmation, and a stateless audit architecture provide
defense-in-depth for security and compliance. The result is Banking Done Right:
demonstrating that regulator-approved natural-language interfaces can reliably
support core financial operations under strict governance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OBCache提出了一种基于结构化剪枝理论的KV缓存淘汰框架，通过量化token对注意力输出的影响来优化缓存管理，相比基于启发式注意力权重的现有方法能显著提升长上下文准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM上下文窗口扩展，KV缓存的内存开销呈线性增长，现有基于累积注意力权重的启发式缓存淘汰方法未能考虑token对注意力输出的真实影响。

Method: 将缓存淘汰建模为分层结构化剪枝问题，基于Optimal Brain Damage理论推导闭式解来量化token重要性，考虑注意力权重、值状态和注意力输出的综合影响。

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen模型上的实验表明，用OBCache的输出感知分数替换现有方法的启发式分数，能持续提升长上下文任务的准确性。

Conclusion: OBCache提供了一种理论驱动的缓存淘汰框架，通过输出感知的token重要性评估，有效解决了长上下文LLM的内存效率问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows enable powerful
downstream applications but impose significant memory overhead, as caching all
key-value (KV) states scales linearly with sequence length and batch size.
Existing cache eviction methods address this by exploiting attention sparsity,
yet they typically rank tokens heuristically using accumulated attention
weights without considering their true impact on attention outputs. We propose
Optimal Brain Cache (OBCache), a principled framework that formulates cache
eviction as a layer-wise structured pruning problem. Building upon the Optimal
Brain Damage (OBD) theory, OBCache quantifies token saliency by measuring the
perturbation in attention outputs induced by pruning tokens, with closed-form
scores derived for isolated keys, isolated values, and joint key-value pairs.
Our scores account not only for attention weights but also for information from
value states and attention outputs, thereby enhancing existing eviction
strategies with output-aware signals. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen models
demonstrate that replacing the heuristic scores in existing works, which
estimate token saliency across different query positions, with OBCache's
output-aware scores consistently improves long-context accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文比较了语言模型社会偏见评估的两种方法：基于token概率的传统方法和基于自然语言推理的新方法，发现两者行为差异显著且相关性很低，建议结合使用多种评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的token概率偏见度量方法虽然应用广泛，但被批评与真实语言模型使用场景和危害脱节，因此需要探索更现实的替代评估方法。

Method: 测试自然语言推理作为更现实的偏见度量替代方案，比较NLI与TP偏见评估的行为差异和相关关系。

Result: NLI和TP偏见评估行为差异显著，相关性很低；NLI方法更可能检测到"去偏见不足"的情况，但对反刻板印象句子的措辞更敏感和脆弱。

Conclusion: token概率和自然语言推理都不是在所有情况下"更好"的偏见度量方法，建议结合TP、NLI和下游偏见评估来确保语言模型的全面评估。

Abstract: Measurement of social bias in language models is typically by token
probability (TP) metrics, which are broadly applicable but have been criticized
for their distance from real-world langugage model use cases and harms. In this
work, we test natural language inference (NLI) as a more realistic alternative
bias metric. We show that, curiously, NLI and TP bias evaluation behave
substantially differently, with very low correlation among different NLI
metrics and between NLI and TP metrics. We find that NLI metrics are more
likely to detect "underdebiased" cases. However, NLI metrics seem to be more
brittle and sensitive to wording of counterstereotypical sentences than TP
approaches. We conclude that neither token probability nor natural language
inference is a "better" bias metric in all cases, and we recommend a
combination of TP, NLI, and downstream bias evaluations to ensure comprehensive
evaluation of language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI宪法和模型规范面临内部原则冲突和场景覆盖不足的挑战，需要系统化方法来识别这些问题。

Method: 通过生成迫使模型在竞争性价值原则间做出明确权衡的场景，使用全面分类法生成多样化的价值权衡场景，评估12个前沿LLM的行为分歧。

Result: 识别出超过70,000个显著行为分歧案例，发现模型行为的高度分歧强烈预测模型规范中的潜在问题，揭示了直接矛盾、解释歧义、错位案例和误报拒绝等问题。

Conclusion: 该方法有效识别了当前模型规范中的系统性缺陷，为改进AI宪法和模型规范提供了重要见解和工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained from AI constitutions
and model specifications that establish behavioral guidelines and ethical
principles. However, these specifications face critical challenges, including
internal conflicts between principles and insufficient coverage of nuanced
scenarios. We present a systematic methodology for stress-testing model
character specifications, automatically identifying numerous cases of principle
contradictions and interpretive ambiguities in current model specs.
  We stress test current model specs by generating scenarios that force
explicit tradeoffs between competing value-based principles. Using a
comprehensive taxonomy we generate diverse value tradeoff scenarios where
models must choose between pairs of legitimate principles that cannot be
simultaneously satisfied. We evaluate responses from twelve frontier LLMs
across major providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI) and measure behavioral
disagreement through value classification scores. Among these scenarios, we
identify over 70,000 cases exhibiting significant behavioral divergence.
Empirically, we show this high divergence in model behavior strongly predicts
underlying problems in model specifications. Through qualitative analysis, we
provide numerous example issues in current model specs such as direct
contradiction and interpretive ambiguities of several principles. Additionally,
our generated dataset also reveals both clear misalignment cases and
false-positive refusals across all of the frontier models we study. Lastly, we
also provide value prioritization patterns and differences of these models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming cellular biology by enabling
the development of "virtual cells"--computational systems that represent,
predict, and reason about cellular states and behaviors. This work provides a
comprehensive review of LLMs for virtual cell modeling. We propose a unified
taxonomy that organizes existing methods into two paradigms: LLMs as Oracles,
for direct cellular modeling, and LLMs as Agents, for orchestrating complex
scientific tasks. We identify three core tasks--cellular representation,
perturbation prediction, and gene regulation inference--and review their
associated models, datasets, evaluation benchmarks, as well as the critical
challenges in scalability, generalizability, and interpretability.

TL;DR: 提出了CADET因果表示学习框架，通过解构仇恨言论为可解释的潜在因素并控制混杂变量，从而从表面语言线索中分离真实的仇恨意图，在多样化风格变化中实现鲁棒的仇恨言论检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有仇恨言论检测模型主要依赖表层语言线索，难以有效泛化到多样化的风格变化。不同平台上的仇恨言论往往针对不同群体并采用独特风格，可能导致标签与风格间的伪相关，进一步挑战现有检测方法。

Method: 将仇恨言论生成建模为涉及关键因素（上下文环境、创作者动机、目标和风格）的因果图。基于此图提出CADET因果表示学习框架，解构仇恨言论为可解释的潜在因素并控制混杂变量，通过在潜在空间中对风格进行干预实现反事实推理。

Result: CADET在综合实验中表现出优越性能，突显了因果先验在推进可泛化仇恨言论检测方面的潜力。

Conclusion: 因果表示学习框架CADET能够有效分离真实的仇恨意图与表面语言线索，在多样化风格变化中实现鲁棒的仇恨言论检测，为可泛化的仇恨言论检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: The proliferation of online hate speech poses a significant threat to the
harmony of the web. While explicit hate is easily recognized through overt
slurs, implicit hate speech is often conveyed through sarcasm, irony,
stereotypes, or coded language -- making it harder to detect. Existing hate
speech detection models, which predominantly rely on surface-level linguistic
cues, fail to generalize effectively across diverse stylistic variations.
Moreover, hate speech spread on different platforms often targets distinct
groups and adopts unique styles, potentially inducing spurious correlations
between them and labels, further challenging current detection approaches.
Motivated by these observations, we hypothesize that the generation of hate
speech can be modeled as a causal graph involving key factors: contextual
environment, creator motivation, target, and style. Guided by this graph, we
propose CADET, a causal representation learning framework that disentangles
hate speech into interpretable latent factors and then controls confounders,
thereby isolating genuine hate intent from superficial linguistic cues.
Furthermore, CADET allows counterfactual reasoning by intervening on style
within the latent space, naturally guiding the model to robustly identify hate
speech in varying forms. CADET demonstrates superior performance in
comprehensive experiments, highlighting the potential of causal priors in
advancing generalizable hate speech detection.

TL;DR: MemWeaver是一个将用户文本历史编织成分层记忆的框架，通过行为记忆和认知记忆两个互补组件来捕捉用户兴趣的时间演化和语义关系，实现深度个性化生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户与互联网的交互方式正在从隐式反馈转向显式文本交互，这为深度个性化提供了丰富的数据源。然而现有方法仅将用户历史视为扁平文本列表进行检索，无法建模反映用户兴趣动态特性的丰富时间和语义结构。

Method: 提出MemWeaver框架，将用户整个文本历史编织成分层记忆。核心创新是构建两个互补的记忆组件：行为记忆捕捉具体用户行为，认知记忆表示长期偏好，两者都整合了时间和语义信息但处于不同的抽象层次。

Result: 在Language Model Personalization (LaMP)基准测试上的实验验证了MemWeaver的有效性。

Conclusion: MemWeaver通过分层记忆结构成功捕捉了用户兴趣的时间演化和语义关系，为大型语言模型提供了统一的用户表示，使其能够同时推理具体行为和抽象特征，实现了深度个性化生成。

implicit feedback signals, such as browsing and clicks, to harnessing the rich
explicit feedback provided by textual interactive behaviors. This shift unlocks
a rich source of user textual history, presenting a profound opportunity for a
deeper form of personalization. However, prevailing approaches offer only a
shallow form of personalization, as they treat user history as a flat list of
texts for retrieval and fail to model the rich temporal and semantic structures
reflecting dynamic nature of user interests. In this work, we propose
\textbf{MemWeaver}, a framework that weaves the user's entire textual history
into a hierarchical memory to power deeply personalized generation. The core
innovation of our memory lies in its ability to capture both the temporal
evolution of interests and the semantic relationships between different
activities. To achieve this, MemWeaver builds two complementary memory
components that both integrate temporal and semantic information, but at
different levels of abstraction: behavioral memory, which captures specific
user actions, and cognitive memory, which represents long-term preferences.
This dual-component memory serves as a unified representation of the user,
allowing large language models (LLMs) to reason over both concrete behaviors
and abstracted traits. Experiments on the Language Model Personalization (LaMP)
benchmark validate the efficacy of MemWeaver. Our code is
available\footnote{https://github.com/fishsure/MemWeaver}.

TL;DR: SubQRAG是一个基于子问题驱动的图检索增强生成框架，通过将复杂问题分解为可验证的子问题链，动态扩展知识图谱，并构建图记忆来增强多跳问答的推理深度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的图RAG方法虽然能连接文档语料库中的分散事实，但在复杂多跳问答中缺乏深度结构化推理，导致证据不完整和错误累积。

Method: 将复杂问题分解为有序的子问题链，为每个子问题从图中检索相关三元组，当现有图谱不足时实时从源文档中提取新三元组，并将所有使用的三元组聚合为图记忆。

Result: 在三个多跳问答基准测试中，SubQRAG实现了持续且显著的改进，特别是在精确匹配分数方面。

Conclusion: SubQRAG通过子问题驱动的框架有效增强了推理深度，解决了传统图RAG在多跳问答中的局限性，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) effectively builds a
knowledge graph (KG) to connect disparate facts across a large document corpus.
However, this broad-view approach often lacks the deep structured reasoning
needed for complex multi-hop question answering (QA), leading to incomplete
evidence and error accumulation. To address these limitations, we propose
SubQRAG, a sub-question-driven framework that enhances reasoning depth. SubQRAG
decomposes a complex question into an ordered chain of verifiable
sub-questions. For each sub-question, it retrieves relevant triples from the
graph. When the existing graph is insufficient, the system dynamically expands
it by extracting new triples from source documents in real time. All triples
used in the reasoning process are aggregated into a "graph memory," forming a
structured and traceable evidence path for final answer generation. Experiments
on three multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that SubQRAG achieves consistent
and significant improvements, especially in Exact Match scores.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM的多语言知识图谱补全框架，通过知识级分组混合专家和迭代实体重排来利用跨语言共享知识，在5种语言的数据集上相比现有SOTA方法显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多语言知识图谱补全研究未能充分利用LLM的多语言能力，并忽视了跨语言知识的可共享性。

Method: 提出了包含两个组件的框架：知识级分组混合专家（KL-GMoE）用于高效建模共享知识，迭代实体重排（IER）用于显著增强共享知识的利用。

Result: 在包含5种语言的mKG数据集上，与现有SOTA方法相比，在Hits@1、Hits@3和Hits@10指标上分别提升了5.47%、3.27%和1.01%。

Conclusion: 该框架有效利用了跨语言共享知识，显著提升了多语言知识图谱补全性能，并揭示了在未见语言和不平衡语言设置下的知识共享特性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Multilingual Knowledge Graph Completion
(MKGC) aim to predict missing facts by leveraging LLMs' multilingual
understanding capabilities, improving the completeness of multilingual
knowledge graphs (KGs). However, existing MKGC research underutilizes the
multilingual capabilities of LLMs and ignores the shareability of cross-lingual
knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel MKGC framework that leverages
multilingual shared knowledge to significantly enhance performance through two
components: Knowledge-level Grouped Mixture of Experts (KL-GMoE) and Iterative
Entity Reranking (IER). KL-GMoE efficiently models shared knowledge, while IER
significantly enhances its utilization. To evaluate our framework, we
constructed a mKG dataset containing 5 languages and conducted comprehensive
comparative experiments with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) MKGC method. The
experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves improvements of
5.47%, 3.27%, and 1.01% in the Hits@1, Hits@3, and Hits@10 metrics,
respectively, compared with SOTA MKGC method. Further experimental analysis
revealed the properties of knowledge sharing in settings of unseen and
unbalanced languages. We have released the dataset and code for our work on

TL;DR: 提出了ToolExpander框架，通过动态多轮硬采样和自示例思考两个创新，解决了GRPO训练中模型响应不准确和训练崩溃的问题，显著提升了小规模LLM的工具使用能力和训练稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO训练LLM时面临模型响应不准确、小规模架构性能差、训练中崩溃等问题，限制了性能提升和GRPO潜力发挥。

Method: ToolExpander框架包含：(1)动态多轮硬采样，用高质量少样本演示替换困难样本，配合指数学习率衰减；(2)自示例思考，消除KL散度并调整裁剪系数，鼓励模型自主生成分析少样本示例。

Result: ToolExpander显著增强了LLM的工具使用能力，特别是在较弱的小规模模型中，同时改善了训练稳定性和整体性能。

Conclusion: ToolExpander通过创新的动态采样和自示例机制，有效解决了GRPO训练中的关键问题，为资源受限的LLM提供了稳定高效的工具导向强化学习方案。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) encounters a significant challenge: models often fail to produce
accurate responses, particularly in small-scale architectures. This limitation
not only diminishes performance improvements and undermines the potential of
GRPO but also frequently leads to mid-training collapse, adversely affecting
stability and final efficacy. To address these issues, we propose ToolExpander,
a novel framework that advances tool-oriented reinforcement learning for
resource-constrained LLMs through two key innovations:(1) Dynamic Multi-Round
Hard Sampling, which dynamically substitutes challenging samples(those without
correct outputs over 10 rollouts) with high-quality few-shot demonstrations
during training, coupled with an exponential learning rate decay strategy to
mitigate oscillations;(2) Self-Exemplifying Thinking, an enhanced GRPO
framework that eliminates KL divergence and incorporates adjusted clipping
coefficients, encouraging models to autonomously generate and analyze few-shot
examples via a minimal additional reward (0.01).Experimental results
demonstrate that ToolExpander significantly enhances tool-using capabilities in
LLMs, especially in weaker small-scale models, improving both training
stability and overall performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OpenRubrics是一个大规模(prompt, rubric)对数据集，通过对比性rubric生成和拒绝采样技术，训练rubric生成和基于rubric的奖励模型，在多个基准测试中显著优于传统奖励模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的奖励模型主要依赖标量或成对判断，无法捕捉人类偏好的多维度特性。虽然已有研究探索使用结构化自然语言标准(rubrics)作为奖励，但生成可靠且可扩展的rubrics仍然是一个关键挑战。

Method: 引入对比性rubric生成(CRG)技术，通过对比偏好和拒绝响应来推导硬规则(显式约束)和原则(隐含质量)，并通过拒绝采样强制执行偏好标签一致性以去除噪声rubrics。

Result: 在多个奖励建模基准测试中，基于rubric的奖励模型Rubric-RM比强基线模型提升了6.8%。这些收益在指令遵循和生物医学基准测试中也能转移到策略模型上。

Conclusion: rubrics提供了可扩展的对齐信号，缩小了昂贵的人工评估与自动化奖励建模之间的差距，为LLM对齐开启了新的原则驱动范式。

Abstract: Reward modeling lies at the core of reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), yet most existing reward models rely on scalar or pairwise
judgments that fail to capture the multifaceted nature of human preferences.
Recent studies have explored rubrics-as-rewards (RaR) that uses structured
natural language criteria that capture multiple dimensions of response quality.
However, producing rubrics that are both reliable and scalable remains a key
challenge. In this work, we introduce OpenRubrics, a diverse, large-scale
collection of (prompt, rubric) pairs for training rubric-generation and
rubric-based reward models. To elicit discriminative and comprehensive
evaluation signals, we introduce Contrastive Rubric Generation (CRG), which
derives both hard rules (explicit constraints) and principles (implicit
qualities) by contrasting preferred and rejected responses. We further improve
reliability by enforcing preference-label consistency via rejection sampling to
remove noisy rubrics. Across multiple reward-modeling benchmarks, our
rubric-based reward model, Rubric-RM, surpasses strong size-matched baselines
by 6.8%. These gains transfer to policy models on instruction-following and
biomedical benchmarks. Our results show that rubrics provide scalable alignment
signals that narrow the gap between costly human evaluation and automated
reward modeling, enabling a new principle-driven paradigm for LLM alignment.

Motivation: 现有并行测试时扩展方法主要针对显式链式思维，而潜在推理模型在连续向量空间中进行推理，缺乏有效的采样机制和概率信号进行轨迹聚合，因此需要开发适用于连续空间的并行扩展方法。

Method: 提出两种不确定性启发的随机采样策略：蒙特卡洛Dropout和加性高斯噪声；设计潜在奖励模型，通过步级对比目标训练来评分和指导潜在推理轨迹。

Result: 实验表明两种采样策略都能有效随计算量扩展，并展现出不同的探索动态；潜在奖励模型能够有效进行轨迹选择，为连续空间的可扩展推理开辟了新方向。

Conclusion: 该工作成功实现了潜在推理模型的并行测试时扩展，通过创新的采样和聚合方法解决了连续空间推理的扩展挑战，为大规模语言模型的高效推理提供了新途径。

Abstract: Parallel test-time scaling (TTS) is a pivotal approach for enhancing large
language models (LLMs), typically by sampling multiple token-based
chains-of-thought in parallel and aggregating outcomes through voting or
search. Recent advances in latent reasoning, where intermediate reasoning
unfolds in continuous vector spaces, offer a more efficient alternative to
explicit Chain-of-Thought, yet whether such latent models can similarly benefit
from parallel TTS remains open, mainly due to the absence of sampling
mechanisms in continuous space, and the lack of probabilistic signals for
advanced trajectory aggregation. \ This work enables parallel TTS for latent
reasoning models by addressing the above issues. For sampling, we introduce two
uncertainty-inspired stochastic strategies: Monte Carlo Dropout and Additive
Gaussian Noise. For aggregation, we design a Latent Reward Model (LatentRM)
trained with step-wise contrastive objective to score and guide latent
reasoning. Extensive experiments and visualization analyses show that both
sampling strategies scale effectively with compute and exhibit distinct
exploration dynamics, while LatentRM enables effective trajectory selection.
Together, our explorations open a new direction for scalable inference in
continuous spaces. Code released at https://github.com/YRYangang/LatentTTS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在多项选择题回答中的推理策略，特别是当模型仅基于选项就能成功时，这种部分输入的成功是否总是有问题的。

Method: 让推理型LLMs在完整输入和仅选项输入下解决MCQs，分析推理轨迹的长度和忠实性，以识别模型使用的策略。

Result: 测试时推理在完整输入和半数仅选项情况下提高准确率；仅选项的成功几乎不受推理轨迹长度影响；推理轨迹通过忠实性测试，显示模型使用了较不有问题的策略。

Conclusion: 部分输入的成功并不总是缺陷，推理轨迹可以帮助区分有问题的数据和较不有问题的推理策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now give reasoning before answering, excelling
in tasks like multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). Yet, a concern is that
LLMs do not solve MCQs as intended, as work finds LLMs sans reasoning succeed
in MCQA without using the question, i.e., choices-only. Such partial-input
success is often deemed problematic, but reasoning traces could reveal if these
strategies are truly shallow in choices-only settings. To study these
strategies, reasoning LLMs solve MCQs in full and choices-only inputs;
test-time reasoning often boosts accuracy on full and in choices-only half the
time. While possibly due to shallow shortcuts, choices-only success is barely
affected by the length of reasoning traces, and after finding traces pass
faithfulness tests, we show they use less problematic strategies like inferring
missing questions. In all, we challenge claims that partial-input success is
always a flaw, so we discuss how reasoning traces could separate problematic
data from less problematic reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with external tools have demonstrated
enhanced performance on complex reasoning tasks. The widespread adoption of
this tool-augmented reasoning is hindered by the scarcity of domain-specific
tools. For instance, in domains such as physics question answering, suitable
and specialized tools are often missing. Recent work has explored automating
tool creation by extracting reusable functions from Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning traces; however, these approaches face a critical scalability
bottleneck. As the number of generated tools grows, storing them in an
unstructured collection leads to significant retrieval challenges, including an
expanding search space and ambiguity between function-related tools. To address
this, we propose a systematic approach to automatically refactor an
unstructured collection of tools into a structured tool library. Our system
first generates discrete, task-specific tools and clusters them into
semantically coherent topics. Within each cluster, we introduce a multi-agent
framework to consolidate scattered functionalities: a code agent refactors code
to extract shared logic and creates versatile, aggregated tools, while a
reviewing agent ensures that these aggregated tools maintain the complete
functional capabilities of the original set. This process transforms numerous
question-specific tools into a smaller set of powerful, aggregated tools
without loss of functionality. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly improves tool retrieval accuracy and overall reasoning
performance across multiple reasoning tasks. Furthermore, our method shows
enhanced scalability compared with baselines as the number of question-specific
increases.

Motivation: 传统基于结果的奖励方法容易导致奖励欺骗，模型可能通过错误推理过程得到正确答案，造成对模型推理能力的高估。

Method: 引入Rubric Reward Model (RRM)，这是一个过程导向的奖励函数，根据问题特定标准评估整个推理轨迹，提供细粒度的校准奖励，明确惩罚逻辑缺陷并鼓励严谨推导。

Result: 在四个数学基准测试中，RRM训练始终优于仅基于结果的监督方法，将AIME2024的Verified Pass@1024从26.7%提升至62.6%，奇迹步骤发生率减少71%。

Conclusion: 奖励解决方案过程对于构建不仅更准确而且更可靠的模型至关重要，过程导向的奖励是解决数学推理中奖励欺骗问题的有效方法。

Abstract: Large language models for mathematical reasoning are typically trained with
outcome-based rewards, which credit only the final answer. In our experiments,
we observe that this paradigm is highly susceptible to reward hacking, leading
to a substantial overestimation of a model's reasoning ability. This is
evidenced by a high incidence of false positives - solutions that reach the
correct final answer through an unsound reasoning process. Through a systematic
analysis with human verification, we establish a taxonomy of these failure
modes, identifying patterns like Miracle Steps - abrupt jumps to a correct
output without a valid preceding derivation. Probing experiments suggest a
strong association between these Miracle Steps and memorization, where the
model appears to recall the answer directly rather than deriving it. To
mitigate this systemic issue, we introduce the Rubric Reward Model (RRM), a
process-oriented reward function that evaluates the entire reasoning trajectory
against problem-specific rubrics. The generative RRM provides fine-grained,
calibrated rewards (0-1) that explicitly penalize logical flaws and encourage
rigorous deduction. When integrated into a reinforcement learning pipeline,
RRM-based training consistently outperforms outcome-only supervision across
four math benchmarks. Notably, it boosts Verified Pass@1024 on AIME2024 from
26.7% to 62.6% and reduces the incidence of Miracle Steps by 71%. Our work
demonstrates that rewarding the solution process is crucial for building models
that are not only more accurate but also more reliable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前对LLM幻觉的研究主要集中在检测和缓解以提高真实性，但忽视了增强真实性可能对安全对齐产生的负面影响，即提高事实准确性往往以削弱拒绝行为为代价。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器将拒绝相关特征与幻觉特征解耦，并通过子空间正交化在微调过程中保持拒绝行为。

Result: 在常识推理任务和有害基准测试（AdvBench和StrongReject）上的评估表明，该方法能够保持拒绝行为和任务效用，缓解真实性与安全性之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了真实性与安全对齐之间的权衡关系，并提出了一种有效的方法来同时保持模型的真实性和安全对齐能力。

Abstract: Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) has been widely studied in
recent years, with progress in both detection and mitigation aimed at improving
truthfulness. Yet, a critical side effect remains largely overlooked: enhancing
truthfulness can negatively impact safety alignment. In this paper, we
investigate this trade-off and show that increasing factual accuracy often
comes at the cost of weakened refusal behavior. Our analysis reveals that this
arises from overlapping components in the model that simultaneously encode
hallucination and refusal information, leading alignment methods to suppress
factual knowledge unintentionally. We further examine how fine-tuning on benign
datasets, even when curated for safety, can degrade alignment for the same
reason. To address this, we propose a method that disentangles refusal-related
features from hallucination features using sparse autoencoders, and preserves
refusal behavior during fine-tuning through subspace orthogonalization. This
approach prevents hallucinations from increasing while maintaining safety
alignment.We evaluate our method on commonsense reasoning tasks and harmful
benchmarks (AdvBench and StrongReject). Results demonstrate that our approach
preserves refusal behavior and task utility, mitigating the trade-off between
truthfulness and safety.

Abstract: Few-shot Multi-label Intent Detection (MID) is crucial for dialogue systems,
aiming to detect multiple intents of utterances in low-resource dialogue
domains. Previous studies focus on a two-stage pipeline. They first learn
representations of utterances with multiple labels and then use a
threshold-based strategy to identify multi-label results. However, these
methods rely on representation classification and ignore instance relations,
leading to error propagation. To solve the above issues, we propose a
multi-label joint learning method for few-shot MID in an end-to-end manner,
which constructs an instance relation learning network with label knowledge
propagation to eliminate error propagation. Concretely, we learn the
interaction relations between instances with class information to propagate
label knowledge between a few labeled (support set) and unlabeled (query set)
instances. With label knowledge propagation, the relation strength between
instances directly indicates whether two utterances belong to the same intent
for multi-label prediction. Besides, a dual relation-enhanced loss is developed
to optimize support- and query-level relation strength to improve performance.
Experiments show that we outperform strong baselines by an average of 9.54% AUC
and 11.19% Macro-F1 in 1-shot scenarios.

Motivation: LLMs在单轮任务中表现出色，但在现实多轮交互中面临上下文漂移的挑战 - 模型输出逐渐偏离目标一致行为，这种漂移在时间维度展开且难以用静态指标衡量。

Conclusion: 多轮漂移可被理解为可控的均衡现象而非必然衰减，为研究缓解扩展交互中的上下文漂移提供了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at single-turn tasks such as instruction
following and summarization, yet real-world deployments require sustained
multi-turn interactions where user goals and conversational context persist and
evolve. A recurring challenge in this setting is context drift: the gradual
divergence of a model's outputs from goal-consistent behavior across turns.
Unlike single-turn errors, drift unfolds temporally and is poorly captured by
static evaluation metrics. In this work, we present a study of context drift in
multi-turn interactions and propose a simple dynamical framework to interpret
its behavior. We formalize drift as the turn-wise KL divergence between the
token-level predictive distributions of the test model and a goal-consistent
reference model, and propose a recurrence model that interprets its evolution
as a bounded stochastic process with restoring forces and controllable
interventions. We instantiate this framework in both synthetic long-horizon
rewriting tasks and realistic user-agent simulations such as in $\tau$-Bench,
measuring drift for several open-weight LLMs that are used as user simulators.
Our experiments consistently reveal stable, noise-limited equilibria rather
than runaway degradation, and demonstrate that simple reminder interventions
reliably reduce divergence in line with theoretical predictions. Together,
these results suggest that multi-turn drift can be understood as a controllable
equilibrium phenomenon rather than as inevitable decay, providing a foundation
for studying and mitigating context drift in extended interactions.

Motivation: 大语言模型在剪枝时通常只使用少量校准数据，导致输出不匹配不可避免。直接最小二乘拟合容易过拟合校准集，破坏预训练权重。

Method: 在旋转约束下更新剪枝参数，保持输出表示的几何特性（范数和内积），同时重新对齐剪枝子空间与原始输出。结合方差感知重要性评分，优先保留对主方向贡献大的维度。

Result: 在LLaMA-7B模型上的实验表明，在WikiText-2和多个语言理解基准上，相比现有基线方法，该方法在困惑度和任务准确率方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 旋转约束补偿方法能有效补偿剪枝误差，同时以几何保持的方式保留可能更重要的组件，在多个评估指标上优于现有方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a rotation-constrained compensation method to
address the errors introduced by structured pruning of large language models
(LLMs). LLMs are trained on massive datasets and accumulate rich semantic
knowledge in their representation space. In contrast, pruning is typically
carried out with only a small amount of calibration data, which makes output
mismatches unavoidable. Although direct least-squares fitting can reduce such
errors, it tends to overfit to the limited calibration set, destructively
modifying pretrained weights. To overcome this difficulty, we update the pruned
parameters under a rotation constraint. This constrained update preserves the
geometry of output representations (i.e., norms and inner products) and
simultaneously re-aligns the pruned subspace with the original outputs.
Furthermore, in rotation-constrained compensation, removing components that
strongly contribute to the principal directions of the output makes error
recovery difficult. Since input dimensions with large variance strongly affect
these principal directions, we design a variance-aware importance score that
ensures such dimensions are preferentially kept in the pruned model. By
combining this scoring rule with rotation-constrained updates, the proposed
method effectively compensates errors while retaining the components likely to
be more important in a geometry-preserving manner. In the experiments, we apply
the proposed method to LLaMA-7B and evaluate it on WikiText-2 and multiple
language understanding benchmarks. The results demonstrate consistently better
perplexity and task accuracy compared with existing baselines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and emerging agentic frameworks are beginning to
transform single-cell biology by enabling natural-language reasoning,
generative annotation, and multimodal data integration. However, progress
remains fragmented across data modalities, architectures, and evaluation
standards. LLM4Cell presents the first unified survey of 58 foundation and
agentic models developed for single-cell research, spanning RNA, ATAC,
multi-omic, and spatial modalities. We categorize these methods into five
families-foundation, text-bridge, spatial, multimodal, epigenomic, and
agentic-and map them to eight key analytical tasks including annotation,
trajectory and perturbation modeling, and drug-response prediction. Drawing on
over 40 public datasets, we analyze benchmark suitability, data diversity, and
ethical or scalability constraints, and evaluate models across 10 domain
dimensions covering biological grounding, multi-omics alignment, fairness,
privacy, and explainability. By linking datasets, models, and evaluation
domains, LLM4Cell provides the first integrated view of language-driven
single-cell intelligence and outlines open challenges in interpretability,
standardization, and trustworthy model development.

### [41] [HiPRAG: Hierarchical Process Rewards for Efficient Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07794)
*Peilin Wu,Mian Zhang,Kun Wan,Wentian Zhao,Kaiyu He,Xinya Du,Zhiyu Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HiPRAG是一种用于优化Agentic RAG系统搜索行为的训练方法，通过分层过程奖励机制减少过度搜索和搜索不足的问题，在多个QA基准测试中显著提高了搜索效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Agentic RAG系统存在过度搜索（检索已知信息）和搜索不足（需要时未搜索）的问题，而基于结果的强化学习训练方法缺乏细粒度控制来解决这些效率低下的问题。

Method: 提出HiPRAG方法，将细粒度的、基于知识的过程奖励整合到强化学习训练中，通过将代理的推理轨迹分解为离散可解析的步骤，实时评估每个搜索决策的必要性，并应用分层奖励函数。

Result: 在Qwen2.5和Llama-3.2模型上的七个QA基准测试中，平均准确率达到65.4%（3B）和67.2%（7B），同时将过度搜索率降至2.3%，并降低了搜索不足率。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了通过强化学习进行细粒度控制对于提高搜索代理推理效率和最优性的重要性和潜力，强调了优化推理过程本身而不仅仅是最终结果的价值。

Abstract: Agentic RAG is a powerful technique for incorporating external information
that LLMs lack, enabling better problem solving and question answering.
However, suboptimal search behaviors exist widely, such as over-search
(retrieving information already known) and under-search (failing to search when
necessary), which leads to unnecessary overhead and unreliable outputs. Current
training methods, which typically rely on outcome-based rewards in a RL
framework, lack the fine-grained control needed to address these
inefficiencies. To overcome this, we introduce Hierarchical Process Rewards for
Efficient agentic RAG (HiPRAG), a training methodology that incorporates a
fine-grained, knowledge-grounded process reward into the RL training. Our
approach evaluates the necessity of each search decision on-the-fly by
decomposing the agent's reasoning trajectory into discrete, parsable steps. We
then apply a hierarchical reward function that provides an additional bonus
based on the proportion of optimal search and non-search steps, on top of
commonly used outcome and format rewards. Experiments on the Qwen2.5 and
Llama-3.2 models across seven diverse QA benchmarks show that our method
achieves average accuracies of 65.4% (3B) and 67.2% (7B). This is accomplished
while improving search efficiency, reducing the over-search rate to just 2.3%
and concurrently lowering the under-search rate. These results demonstrate the
efficacy of optimizing the reasoning process itself, not just the final
outcome. Further experiments and analysis demonstrate that HiPRAG shows good
generalizability across a wide range of RL algorithms, model families, sizes,
and types. This work demonstrates the importance and potential of fine-grained
control through RL, for improving the efficiency and optimality of reasoning
for search agents.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为GTD的生成框架，通过迭代构建过程生成多智能体系统的通信拓扑，使用轻量级代理模型预测多目标奖励，实现任务自适应拓扑的实时优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统的效率很大程度上取决于通信拓扑，但设计最优拓扑具有挑战性，需要在任务性能、通信成本和鲁棒性之间平衡。现有静态或手工设计的拓扑无法适应不同任务需求。

Method: GTD框架受条件离散图扩散模型启发，将拓扑合成建模为迭代构建过程。每个步骤使用轻量级代理模型预测多目标奖励（如准确性、效用、成本），实现无梯度实时优化。

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证，GTD能够生成高度任务自适应、稀疏且高效的通信拓扑，在LLM智能体协作中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GTD框架通过迭代引导合成过程，能够更好地处理复杂设计权衡，为多智能体系统提供有效的通信拓扑优化方案。

Abstract: The efficiency of multi-agent systems driven by large language models (LLMs)
largely hinges on their communication topology. However, designing an optimal
topology is a non-trivial challenge, as it requires balancing competing
objectives such as task performance, communication cost, and robustness.
Existing frameworks often rely on static or hand-crafted topologies, which
inherently fail to adapt to diverse task requirements, leading to either
excessive token consumption for simple problems or performance bottlenecks for
complex ones. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel generative
framework called \textit{Guided Topology Diffusion (GTD)}. Inspired by
conditional discrete graph diffusion models, GTD formulates topology synthesis
as an iterative construction process. At each step, the generation is steered
by a lightweight proxy model that predicts multi-objective rewards (e.g.,
accuracy, utility, cost), enabling real-time, gradient-free optimization
towards task-adaptive topologies. This iterative, guided synthesis process
distinguishes GTD from single-step generative frameworks, enabling it to better
navigate complex design trade-offs. We validated GTD across multiple
benchmarks, and experiments show that this framework can generate highly
task-adaptive, sparse, and efficient communication topologies, significantly
outperforming existing methods in LLM agent collaboration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式检索在单语言场景表现优异，但在多语言检索中面临跨语言标识符错位和标识符膨胀两大挑战。

Method: 提出MGR-CSC框架，将语义等价的多语言关键词统一为共享原子以对齐语义并压缩标识符空间，在检索时采用动态多步约束解码策略。

Result: 在mMarco100k和mNQ320k数据集上分别提升检索准确率6.83%和4.77%，同时标识符长度分别减少74.51%和78.2%。

Conclusion: MGR-CSC通过跨语言语义压缩有效解决了多语言生成式检索的关键问题，在提升准确率的同时显著优化了标识符效率。

Abstract: Generative Information Retrieval is an emerging retrieval paradigm that
exhibits remarkable performance in monolingual scenarios.However, applying
these methods to multilingual retrieval still encounters two primary
challenges, cross-lingual identifier misalignment and identifier inflation. To
address these limitations, we propose Multilingual Generative Retrieval via
Cross-lingual Semantic Compression (MGR-CSC), a novel framework that unifies
semantically equivalent multilingual keywords into shared atoms to align
semantics and compresses the identifier space, and we propose a dynamic
multi-step constrained decoding strategy during retrieval. MGR-CSC improves
cross-lingual alignment by assigning consistent identifiers and enhances
decoding efficiency by reducing redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that
MGR-CSC achieves outstanding retrieval accuracy, improving by 6.83% on
mMarco100k and 4.77% on mNQ320k, while reducing document identifiers length by
74.51% and 78.2%, respectively.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaSwitch是一种新颖的知识蒸馏方法，通过在token级别动态结合on-policy和off-policy生成，解决了现有方法在训练-推理一致性和监督质量之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型语言模型在严格延迟和计算约束应用中很重要，但实现高性能具有挑战性。现有知识蒸馏方法存在权衡：off-policy蒸馏提供高质量监督但引入训练-推理不匹配，on-policy方法保持一致性但依赖低质量学生输出。

Method: 提出AdaSwitch方法，在token级别动态结合on-policy和off-policy生成。让学生先探索自己的预测，然后基于实时质量评估选择性地整合教师指导。

Result: 在三个数据集和两个教师-学生LLM对上的实验表明，AdaSwitch持续提高了准确性，为蒸馏SLMs提供了实用有效的方法，且额外开销可接受。

Conclusion: AdaSwitch同时保持了一致性和监督质量，为知识蒸馏提供了一种平衡的解决方案，能够有效提升小型语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are crucial for applications with strict latency
and computational constraints, yet achieving high performance remains
challenging. Knowledge distillation (KD) can transfer capabilities from large
teacher models, but existing methods involve trade-offs: off-policy
distillation provides high-quality supervision but introduces a
training-inference mismatch, while on-policy approaches maintain consistency
but rely on low-quality student outputs. To address these issues, we propose
AdaSwitch, a novel approach that dynamically combines on-policy and off-policy
generation at the token level. AdaSwitch allows the student to first explore
its own predictions and then selectively integrate teacher guidance based on
real-time quality assessment. This approach simultaneously preserves
consistency and maintains supervision quality. Experiments on three datasets
with two teacher-student LLM pairs demonstrate that AdaSwitch consistently
improves accuracy, offering a practical and effective method for distilling
SLMs with acceptable additional overhead.

Result: 开发了统一的评估框架和数据集，代码和数据集已在GitHub上公开。

Conclusion: Translation Tangles为解决大语言模型在翻译质量和公平性方面的挑战提供了系统化的评估工具和数据集。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has redefined Machine Translation
(MT), enabling context-aware and fluent translations across hundreds of
languages and textual domains. Despite their remarkable capabilities, LLMs
often exhibit uneven performance across language families and specialized
domains. Moreover, recent evidence reveals that these models can encode and
amplify different biases present in their training data, posing serious
concerns for fairness, especially in low-resource languages. To address these
gaps, we introduce Translation Tangles, a unified framework and dataset for
evaluating the translation quality and fairness of open-source LLMs. Our
approach benchmarks 24 bidirectional language pairs across multiple domains
using different metrics. We further propose a hybrid bias detection pipeline
that integrates rule-based heuristics, semantic similarity filtering, and
LLM-based validation. We also introduce a high-quality, bias-annotated dataset
based on human evaluations of 1,439 translation-reference pairs. The code and
dataset are accessible on GitHub:

TL;DR: 该论文分析了长思维链模型中的"过度思考"问题，提出了TRACE分析框架来系统研究其根本原因，发现过度验证和过度探索是主要驱动因素，并提出了基于效用的过度思考定义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长思维链模型在复杂推理任务中表现出色，但带来了严重的效率问题——过度思考，即模型对简单查询也进行不必要的长推理，导致计算成本增加而准确率没有提升。现有研究对过度思考的根本原因理解不足，大多停留在表面分析层面。

Method: 提出了TRACE分析框架：1）将思维过程分解为最小完整子思维；2）通过推断子思维间的语篇关系构建细粒度思维进展图；3）识别主题相似查询的常见思维模式。

Result: 研究发现长思维模型在简单任务上速度慢5-20倍且无实质收益；识别出两种主要思维模式——探索者和晚期着陆，证明过度验证和过度探索是过度思考的主要驱动因素。

Conclusion: 基于思维结构提出了基于效用的过度思考定义，超越了传统的基于长度的度量方法，为理解LLM思维进展和系统管理过度思考提供了更深入的理论指导和实践方案。

Abstract: Models employing long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have shown superior
performance on complex reasoning tasks. Yet, this capability introduces a
critical and often overlooked inefficiency -- overthinking -- models often
engage in unnecessarily extensive reasoning even for simple queries, incurring
significant computations without accuracy improvements. While prior work has
explored solutions to mitigate overthinking, a fundamental gap remains in our
understanding of its underlying causes. Most existing analyses are limited to
superficial, profiling-based observations, failing to delve into LLMs' inner
workings. This study introduces a systematic, fine-grained analyzer of LLMs'
thought process to bridge the gap, TRACE. We first benchmark the overthinking
issue, confirming that long-thinking models are five to twenty times slower on
simple tasks with no substantial gains. We then use TRACE to first decompose
the thought process into minimally complete sub-thoughts. Next, by inferring
discourse relationships among sub-thoughts, we construct granular thought
progression graphs and subsequently identify common thinking patterns for
topically similar queries. Our analysis reveals two major patterns for
open-weight thinking models -- Explorer and Late Landing. This finding provides
evidence that over-verification and over-exploration are the primary drivers of
overthinking in LLMs. Grounded in thought structures, we propose a
utility-based definition of overthinking, which moves beyond length-based
metrics. This revised definition offers a more insightful understanding of
LLMs' thought progression, as well as practical guidelines for principled
overthinking management.

Abstract: The advancement of multimodal large language models has accelerated the
development of speech-to-speech interaction systems. While natural monolingual
interaction has been achieved, we find existing models exhibit deficiencies in
language alignment. In our proposed Code-Switching Speech-to-Speech Benchmark
(CS3-Bench), experiments on 7 mainstream models demonstrate a relative
performance drop of up to 66% in knowledge-intensive question answering and
varying degrees of misunderstanding in open-ended conversations. Starting from
a model with severe performance deterioration, we propose both data
constructions and training approaches to improve the language alignment
capabilities, specifically employing Chain of Recognition (CoR) to enhance
understanding and Keyword Highlighting (KH) to guide generation. Our approach
improves the knowledge accuracy from 25.14% to 46.13%, with open-ended

Motivation: 弱到强泛化方法受到弱模型输出中噪声和偏见的限制，影响其鲁棒性和泛化能力，需要解决这一问题以提高实际应用性。

Method: 利用隐式奖励（通过对数似然比近似显式奖励）与对比解码的结构等价性，提出ConG框架，在预对齐和对齐后的弱模型之间进行对比解码。

Result: 在不同模型家族上的实证结果证实了持续改进，ConG能够实现更可靠的能力迁移、去噪和鲁棒性提升。

Conclusion: ConG有潜力推进弱到强泛化，为通向通用人工智能提供有前景的路径。

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization provides a promising paradigm for scaling large
language models (LLMs) by training stronger models on samples from aligned
weaker ones, without requiring human feedback or explicit reward modeling.
However, its robustness and generalization are hindered by the noise and biases
in weak-model outputs, which limit its applicability in practice. To address
this challenge, we leverage implicit rewards, which approximate explicit
rewards through log-likelihood ratios, and reveal their structural equivalence
with Contrastive Decoding (CD), a decoding strategy shown to reduce noise in
LLM generation. Building on this connection, we propose Contrastive
Weak-to-Strong Generalization (ConG), a framework that employs contrastive
decoding between pre- and post-alignment weak models to generate higher-quality
samples. This approach enables more reliable capability transfer, denoising,
and improved robustness, substantially mitigating the limitations of
traditional weak-to-strong methods. Empirical results across different model
families confirm consistent improvements, demonstrating the generality and
effectiveness of ConG. Taken together, our findings highlight the potential of
ConG to advance weak-to-strong generalization and provide a promising pathway
toward AGI.

<details>

Motivation: 方言主要是口语形式，非标准拼写在文本处理中存在问题，因此需要研究从标准语言到方言的迁移在不同模态下的效果。

Method: 在德语和多种德语方言的书面和口语意图分类任务中，比较了三种设置：文本模型、语音模型以及语音先自动转录再由文本模型处理的级联系统。

Result: 语音模型在方言数据上表现最佳，文本模型在标准数据上表现最好。级联系统在德语上落后于纯文本模型，但如果转录系统生成规范化的标准输出，则在方言数据上表现相对较好。

Conclusion: 方言处理中语音模型优于文本模型，级联系统的性能取决于转录输出的规范化程度。

Abstract: Research on cross-dialectal transfer from a standard to a non-standard
dialect variety has typically focused on text data. However, dialects are
primarily spoken, and non-standard spellings are known to cause issues in text
processing. We compare standard-to-dialect transfer in three settings: text
models, speech models, and cascaded systems where speech first gets
automatically transcribed and then further processed by a text model. In our
experiments, we focus on German and multiple German dialects in the context of
written and spoken intent and topic classification. To that end, we release the
first dialectal audio intent classification dataset. We find that the
speech-only setup provides the best results on the dialect data while the
text-only setup works best on the standard data. While the cascaded systems lag
behind the text-only models for German, they perform relatively well on the
dialectal data if the transcription system generates normalized, standard-like
output.

Conclusion: MCBench通过客观、确定性和可代码验证的评估方法，为评估LLMs的逐步执行能力提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Recent frontier-level LLMs have saturated many previously difficult
benchmarks, leaving little room for further differentiation. This progress
highlights the need for challenging benchmarks that provide objective
verification. In this paper, we introduce MCBench, a benchmark designed to
evaluate whether LLMs can execute string-matching NLP metrics by strictly
following step-by-step instructions. Unlike prior benchmarks that depend on
subjective judgments or general reasoning, MCBench offers an objective,
deterministic and codeverifiable evaluation. This setup allows us to
systematically test whether LLMs can maintain accurate step-by-step execution,
including instruction adherence, numerical computation, and long-range
consistency in handling intermediate results. To ensure objective evaluation of
these abilities, we provide a parallel reference code that can evaluate the
accuracy of LLM output. We provide three evaluative metrics and three benchmark
variants designed to measure the detailed instruction understanding capability
of LLMs. Our analyses show that MCBench serves as an effective and objective
tool for evaluating the capabilities of cutting-edge LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑方法在多跳事实回忆中表现显著衰减，特别是在涉及推理链中隐式主语时，这源于对链式知识在神经元层面动态表示和利用的忽视。

Method: 通过因果分析发现隐式主语在推理过程中作为查询神经元，跨层激活对应值神经元积累信息。提出ACE框架，利用神经元级归因识别和编辑这些关键查询-值通路。

Result: ACE在多跳知识编辑上表现优于现有方法，在GPT-J上提升9.44%，在Qwen3-8B上提升37.46%。分析还揭示了Qwen3中更细粒度的激活模式。

Conclusion: 基于对内部推理机制的原则性理解，为推进知识编辑能力建立了新途径，证明值神经元的语义可解释性是由查询驱动的积累协调的。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require efficient knowledge editing (KE) to
update factual information, yet existing methods exhibit significant
performance decay in multi-hop factual recall. This failure is particularly
acute when edits involve intermediate implicit subjects within reasoning
chains. Through causal analysis, we reveal that this limitation stems from an
oversight of how chained knowledge is dynamically represented and utilized at
the neuron level. We discover that during multi hop reasoning, implicit
subjects function as query neurons, which sequentially activate corresponding
value neurons across transformer layers to accumulate information toward the
final answer, a dynamic prior KE work has overlooked. Guided by this insight,
we propose ACE: Attribution-Controlled Knowledge Editing for Multi-hop Factual
Recall, a framework that leverages neuron-level attribution to identify and
edit these critical query-value (Q-V) pathways. ACE provides a mechanistically
grounded solution for multi-hop KE, empirically outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by 9.44% on GPT-J and 37.46% on Qwen3-8B. Our analysis further reveals
more fine-grained activation patterns in Qwen3 and demonstrates that the
semantic interpretability of value neurons is orchestrated by query-driven
accumulation. These findings establish a new pathway for advancing KE
capabilities based on the principled understanding of internal reasoning
mechanisms.

Abstract: Automatic grading of subjective questions remains a significant challenge in
examination assessment due to the diversity in question formats and the
open-ended nature of student responses. Existing works primarily focus on a
specific type of subjective question and lack the generality to support
comprehensive exams that contain diverse question types. In this paper, we
propose a unified Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced auto-grading framework
that provides human-like evaluation for all types of subjective questions
across various domains. Our framework integrates four complementary modules to
holistically evaluate student answers. In addition to a basic text matching
module that provides a foundational assessment of content similarity, we
leverage the powerful reasoning and generative capabilities of LLMs to: (1)
compare key knowledge points extracted from both student and reference answers,
(2) generate a pseudo-question from the student answer to assess its relevance
to the original question, and (3) simulate human evaluation by identifying
content-related and non-content strengths and weaknesses. Extensive experiments
on both general-purpose and domain-specific datasets show that our framework
consistently outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines across multiple
grading metrics. Moreover, the proposed system has been successfully deployed
in real-world training and certification exams at a major e-commerce
enterprise.

Abstract: Answering complex real-world questions requires step-by-step retrieval and
integration of relevant information to generate well-grounded responses.
However, existing knowledge distillation methods overlook the need for
different reasoning abilities at different steps, hindering transfer in
multi-step retrieval-augmented frameworks. To address this, we propose Stepwise
Knowledge Distillation for Enhancing Reasoning Ability in Multi-Step
Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (StepER). StepER employs step-wise
supervision to align with evolving information and reasoning demands across
stages. Additionally, it incorporates difficulty-aware training to
progressively optimize learning by prioritizing suitable steps. Our method is
adaptable to various multi-step retrieval-augmented language models, including
those that use retrieval queries for reasoning paths or decomposed questions.
Extensive experiments show that StepER outperforms prior methods on multi-hop

*Adam Dejl,James Barry,Alessandra Pascale,Javier Carnerero Cano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了三种自动化方法来检测LLM生成文本中缺失信息的问题，发现简单的端到端方法效果意外地好，但代价是鲁棒性和可解释性降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生不完整或选择性省略关键信息的输出，在敏感领域这种遗漏可能造成与事实错误相当的严重危害。

Method: 研究调查了三种自动评估策略：(1)基于NLI的方法，将文本分解为原子陈述并使用自然语言推理识别缺失链接；(2)基于Q&A的方法，提取问答对并比较不同来源的响应；(3)端到端方法，直接使用LLM识别缺失内容。

Result: 实验表明简单的端到端方法相比更复杂的方法具有令人惊讶的有效性，但代价是鲁棒性、可解释性和结果粒度降低。研究还评估了几个流行开源LLM在基于多个来源回答用户查询时的响应完整性。

Conclusion: 端到端方法在检测LLM生成文本中缺失信息方面表现良好，但需要权衡鲁棒性和可解释性。这项研究为评估LLM输出的完整性提供了重要方法学基础。

Abstract: Despite demonstrating remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks,
large language models (LLMs) have also been found to frequently produce outputs
that are incomplete or selectively omit key information. In sensitive domains,
such omissions can result in significant harm comparable to that posed by
factual inaccuracies, including hallucinations. In this study, we address the
challenge of evaluating the comprehensiveness of LLM-generated texts, focusing
on the detection of missing information or underrepresented viewpoints. We
investigate three automated evaluation strategies: (1) an NLI-based method that
decomposes texts into atomic statements and uses natural language inference
(NLI) to identify missing links, (2) a Q&A-based approach that extracts
question-answer pairs and compares responses across sources, and (3) an
end-to-end method that directly identifies missing content using LLMs. Our
experiments demonstrate the surprising effectiveness of the simple end-to-end
approach compared to more complex methods, though at the cost of reduced
robustness, interpretability and result granularity. We further assess the
comprehensiveness of responses from several popular open-weight LLMs when
answering user queries based on multiple sources.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究展示了大型语言模型在17-18世纪爱沙尼亚语词典研究中的应用潜力，包括词典信息丰富化、哥特体文字识别和跨源数据集创建，实验结果表明LLMs能显著节省时间和经济资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索大型语言模型在爱沙尼亚语历史词典数字化和丰富化中的应用，特别是针对这种小语种语言资源有限的情况。

Method: 使用Claude 3.7 Sonnet等LLMs进行三个主要实验：1) 为历史词典提供现代词形和含义；2) 零样本方法识别哥特体文字；3) 采用重叠切片扫描图像文件进行文本识别和结构化输出合并。

Result: 在词典丰富化实验中，81%的词条能准确获得含义和现代对应词；在文字识别实验中，41%的词条被成功识别并结构化输出；在数字化过程中采用双LLM协作方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，即使是对于小语种，大型语言模型在历史语言资源处理方面也具有显著潜力，能够有效节省时间和经济成本。

Abstract: This article presents research conducted at the Institute of the Estonian
Language between 2022 and 2025 on the application of large language models
(LLMs) to the study of 17th and 18th century Estonian dictionaries. The authors
address three main areas: enriching historical dictionaries with modern word
forms and meanings; using vision-enabled LLMs to perform text recognition on
sources printed in Gothic script (Fraktur); and preparing for the creation of a
unified, cross-source dataset. Initial experiments with J. Gutslaff's 1648
dictionary indicate that LLMs have significant potential for semi-automatic
enrichment of dictionary information. When provided with sufficient context,
Claude 3.7 Sonnet accurately provided meanings and modern equivalents for 81%
of headword entries. In a text recognition experiment with A. T. Helle's 1732
dictionary, a zero-shot method successfully identified and structured 41% of
headword entries into error-free JSON-formatted output. For digitising the
Estonian-German dictionary section of A. W. Hupel's 1780 grammar, overlapping
tiling of scanned image files is employed, with one LLM being used for text
recognition and a second for merging the structured output. These findings
demonstrate that even for minor languages LLMs have a significant potential for
saving time and financial resources.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A²Search是一个无需标注的端到端训练框架，用于识别和处理开放域问答中的模糊问题，通过轨迹采样和证据验证自动收集替代答案，使用AnsF1奖励进行强化学习优化，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型和强化学习方法在开放域问答中仍难以处理允许多个有效答案的模糊问题，标准问答基准通常假设单一黄金答案，无法提供合适的训练信号，而现有处理模糊性的方法依赖昂贵的人工标注，难以扩展到多跳数据集。

Method: 提出A²Search框架，核心是自动检测模糊问题并通过轨迹采样和证据验证收集替代答案的流程，使用精心设计的AnsF1奖励进行强化学习优化，自然适应多个答案。

Result: 在八个开放域问答基准测试中，A²Search达到新的最先进性能。仅使用单次推理，A²Search-7B在四个多跳基准测试中的平均AnsF1@1得分为48.4%，优于所有强基线，包括更大的ReSearch-32B（46.2%）。

Conclusion: A²Search能够解决模糊性问题并在不同基准测试中泛化，表明接受模糊性对于构建更可靠的问答系统至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning
(RL) have led to strong performance in open-domain question answering (QA).
However, existing models still struggle with questions that admit multiple
valid answers. Standard QA benchmarks, which typically assume a single gold
answer, overlook this reality and thus produce inappropriate training signals.
Existing attempts to handle ambiguity often rely on costly manual annotation,
which is difficult to scale to multi-hop datasets such as HotpotQA and MuSiQue.
In this paper, we present A$^2$Search, an annotation-free, end-to-end training
framework to recognize and handle ambiguity. At its core is an automated
pipeline that detects ambiguous questions and gathers alternative answers via
trajectory sampling and evidence verification. The model is then optimized with
RL using a carefully designed $\mathrm{AnsF1}$ reward, which naturally
accommodates multiple answers. Experiments on eight open-domain QA benchmarks
demonstrate that A$^2$Search achieves new state-of-the-art performance. With
only a single rollout, A$^2$Search-7B yields an average $\mathrm{AnsF1}@1$
score of $48.4\%$ across four multi-hop benchmarks, outperforming all strong
baselines, including the substantially larger ReSearch-32B ($46.2\%$).
Extensive analyses further show that A$^2$Search resolves ambiguity and
generalizes across benchmarks, highlighting that embracing ambiguity is
essential for building more reliable QA systems. Our code, data, and model
weights can be found at https://github.com/zfj1998/A2Search

### [57] [LightReasoner: Can Small Language Models Teach Large Language Models Reasoning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07962)
*Jingyuan Wang,Yankai Chen,Zhonghang Li,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LightReasoner是一个新颖的框架，利用小型语言模型(SLM)来指导大型语言模型(LLM)的推理能力，通过专家-业余对比识别关键推理时刻，显著提升推理准确率同时大幅降低资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的监督微调(SFT)方法资源密集，需要大量标注数据，且对所有token进行统一优化，而实际上只有少数token具有学习价值。

Method: LightReasoner采用两阶段框架：1)采样阶段通过专家(LLM)与业余(SLM)模型的行为差异识别关键推理时刻，构建监督示例；2)微调阶段将专家模型与这些蒸馏示例对齐，增强其推理优势。

Result: 在七个数学基准测试中，LightReasoner将准确率提升高达28.1%，同时减少90%的时间消耗、80%的采样问题和99%的微调token使用，且不依赖真实标签。

Conclusion: 通过将较弱的SLM转化为有效的教学信号，LightReasoner为推进LLM推理提供了一种可扩展且资源高效的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
reasoning, often through supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, SFT is
resource-intensive, relying on large curated datasets, rejection-sampled
demonstrations, and uniform optimization across all tokens, even though only a
fraction carry meaningful learning value. In this work, we explore a
counterintuitive idea: can smaller language models (SLMs) teach larger language
models (LLMs) by revealing high-value reasoning moments that reflect the
latter's unique strength? We propose LightReasoner, a novel framework that
leverages the behavioral divergence between a stronger expert model (LLM) and a
weaker amateur model (SLM). LightReasoner operates in two stages: (1) a
sampling stage that pinpoints critical reasoning moments and constructs
supervision examples capturing the expert's advantage through expert-amateur
contrast, and (2) a fine-tuning stage that aligns the expert model with these
distilled examples, amplifying its reasoning strengths. Across seven
mathematical benchmarks, LightReasoner improves accuracy by up to 28.1%, while
reducing time consumption by 90%, sampled problems by 80%, and tuned token
usage by 99%, all without relying on ground-truth labels. By turning weaker
SLMs into effective teaching signals, LightReasoner offers a scalable and
resource-efficient approach for advancing LLM reasoning. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自适应世界模型增强推理机制，通过构建动态文本世界模型来跟踪实体状态和时间序列，帮助大语言模型解决社交推理中的认知混淆和逻辑不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在数学和代码推理方面表现出色，但在社交推理任务中表现不佳，经常出现认知混淆、逻辑不一致以及客观世界状态与主观信念状态的混淆问题。

Method: 提出自适应世界模型增强推理机制，构建动态文本世界模型来跟踪实体状态和时间序列，动态监控推理轨迹中的混淆指标，及时干预并提供清晰的世界状态描述。

Result: 在三个社交基准测试中显示出显著改进，准确率提高（如Hi-ToM中+10%），同时降低计算成本（最多减少33.8%的token使用）。

Conclusion: 该机制为在社交情境中部署大语言模型提供了一个简单而有效的解决方案，能够显著改善模型的社交推理能力。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel in mathematical and code reasoning,
we observe they struggle with social reasoning tasks, exhibiting cognitive
confusion, logical inconsistencies, and conflation between objective world
states and subjective belief states. Through deteiled analysis of DeepSeek-R1's
reasoning trajectories, we find that LLMs frequently encounter reasoning
impasses and tend to output contradictory terms like "tricky" and "confused"
when processing scenarios with multiple participants and timelines, leading to
erroneous reasoning or infinite loops. The core issue is their inability to
disentangle objective reality from agents' subjective beliefs. To address this,
we propose an adaptive world model-enhanced reasoning mechanism that constructs
a dynamic textual world model to track entity states and temporal sequences. It
dynamically monitors reasoning trajectories for confusion indicators and
promptly intervenes by providing clear world state descriptions, helping models
navigate through cognitive dilemmas. The mechanism mimics how humans use
implicit world models to distinguish between external events and internal
beliefs. Evaluations on three social benchmarks demonstrate significant
improvements in accuracy (e.g., +10% in Hi-ToM) while reducing computational
costs (up to 33.8% token reduction), offering a simple yet effective solution
for deploying LLMs in social contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学图表标题需要同时具备准确性和风格一致性来传达视觉信息，现有方法在保持作者特定写作风格方面存在不足。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：第一阶段结合上下文过滤、使用DSPy的MIPROv2和SIMBA进行类别特定提示优化以及标题候选选择；第二阶段应用基于档案图表的少样本提示进行风格化精炼。

Result: 实验表明类别特定提示在ROUGE-1召回率上提升+8.3%，同时将精度损失限制在-2.8%，BLEU-4减少-10.9%；基于档案的风格化精炼在BLEU得分上获得40-48%增益，在ROUGE上获得25-27%增益。

Conclusion: 结合上下文理解与作者特定风格适应的系统能够生成既科学准确又风格忠实于源论文的图表标题。

Abstract: Scientific figure captions require both accuracy and stylistic consistency to
convey visual information. Here, we present a domain-specific caption
generation system for the 3rd SciCap Challenge that integrates figure-related
textual context with author-specific writing styles using the LaMP-Cap dataset.
Our approach uses a two-stage pipeline: Stage 1 combines context filtering,
category-specific prompt optimization via DSPy's MIPROv2 and SIMBA, and caption
candidate selection; Stage 2 applies few-shot prompting with profile figures
for stylistic refinement. Our experiments demonstrate that category-specific
prompts outperform both zero-shot and general optimized approaches, improving
ROUGE-1 recall by +8.3\% while limiting precision loss to -2.8\% and BLEU-4
reduction to -10.9\%. Profile-informed stylistic refinement yields 40--48\%
gains in BLEU scores and 25--27\% in ROUGE. Overall, our system demonstrates
that combining contextual understanding with author-specific stylistic
adaptation can generate captions that are both scientifically accurate and
stylistically faithful to the source paper.

TL;DR: MUSE是一个基于分层记忆模块的自我进化AI代理框架，能够通过经验积累和反思实现持续学习，在长时程任务中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理在测试时是静态的，无法从经验中学习，缺乏知识积累和持续改进的能力。

Method: 引入以分层记忆模块为中心的经验驱动、自我进化系统，通过任务执行后的自主反思将原始轨迹转化为结构化经验并整合到记忆模块中。

Result: 在TAC基准测试中实现新的SOTA性能，仅使用轻量级Gemini-2.5 Flash模型就取得显著优势，展现出强大的持续学习和自我进化能力，且积累的经验具有强泛化性。

Conclusion: MUSE为能够实现现实世界生产力任务自动化的AI代理建立了新范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse domains, yet significant challenges persist when deploying them as AI
agents for real-world long-horizon tasks. Existing LLM agents suffer from a
critical limitation: they are test-time static and cannot learn from
experience, lacking the ability to accumulate knowledge and continuously
improve on the job. To address this challenge, we propose MUSE, a novel agent
framework that introduces an experience-driven, self-evolving system centered
around a hierarchical Memory Module. MUSE organizes diverse levels of
experience and leverages them to plan and execute long-horizon tasks across
multiple applications. After each sub-task execution, the agent autonomously
reflects on its trajectory, converting the raw trajectory into structured
experience and integrating it back into the Memory Module. This mechanism
enables the agent to evolve beyond its static pretrained parameters, fostering
continuous learning and self-evolution. We evaluate MUSE on the long-horizon
productivity benchmark TAC. It achieves new SOTA performance by a significant
margin using only a lightweight Gemini-2.5 Flash model. Sufficient Experiments
demonstrate that as the agent autonomously accumulates experience, it exhibits
increasingly superior task completion capabilities, as well as robust
continuous learning and self-evolution capabilities. Moreover, the accumulated
experience from MUSE exhibits strong generalization properties, enabling
zero-shot improvement on new tasks. MUSE establishes a new paradigm for AI
agents capable of real-world productivity task automation.

Motivation: 探索ChatGPT在日英翻译任务中的潜力，评估不同提示策略和翻译层级的效果，并与现有商业翻译系统进行对比，以了解其实际应用价值。

Method: 采用自动评估和基于MQM的人工评估方法，比较简单提示与增强提示、文档级与句子级翻译，并对比ChatGPT-3.5与ChatGPT-4以及两个商业翻译系统的表现。

Result: 文档级翻译优于句子级翻译；增强提示与简单提示效果差异不明显；ChatGPT-3.5在自动评估中更受青睐但与ChatGPT-4存在准确性与流畅性权衡；ChatGPT整体与主流翻译系统竞争力相当。

Conclusion: ChatGPT在日英翻译任务中表现出竞争力，文档级翻译策略更有效，但在提示优化和不同版本间的性能权衡方面仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: This study investigates ChatGPT for Japanese-English translation, exploring
simple and enhanced prompts and comparing against commercially available
translation engines. Performing both automatic and MQM-based human evaluations,
we found that document-level translation outperforms sentence-level translation
for ChatGPT. On the other hand, we were not able to determine if enhanced
prompts performed better than simple prompts in our experiments. We also
discovered that ChatGPT-3.5 was preferred by automatic evaluation, but a
tradeoff exists between accuracy (ChatGPT-3.5) and fluency (ChatGPT-4). Lastly,
ChatGPT yields competitive results against two widely-known translation
systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can recall basic climate normals with reasonable accuracy but struggle with complex terrain and climate change patterns, showing limitations in representing regional temperature shifts essential for climate dynamics understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly used for climate applications, it's crucial to assess their internal climatological knowledge for reliability and misinformation risk assessment, particularly their ability to recall climate normals from parametric knowledge.

Method: Constructed a global grid of queries at 1° resolution land points asking for mean July 2-m air temperature 1991-2020 at specified locations, providing coordinates and location descriptors, and validated responses against ERA5 reanalysis.

Result: LLMs encode non-trivial climate structure with RMSE of 3-6°C and biases of ±1°C, but show spatially coherent errors in mountains and high latitudes. Performance degrades sharply above 1500m (RMSE 5-13°C vs 2-4°C at lower elevations). Including geographic context reduces errors by 27% on average.

Conclusion: While LLMs capture present-day climate distributions, they fail to reproduce spatial patterns of temperature change essential for understanding climate dynamics, highlighting limitations in representing regional climate shifts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for climate-related
applications, where understanding internal climatological knowledge is crucial
for reliability and misinformation risk assessment. Despite growing adoption,
the capacity of LLMs to recall climate normals from parametric knowledge
remains largely uncharacterized. We investigate the capacity of contemporary
LLMs to recall climate normals without external retrieval, focusing on a
prototypical query: mean July 2-m air temperature 1991-2020 at specified
locations. We construct a global grid of queries at 1{\deg} resolution land
points, providing coordinates and location descriptors, and validate responses
against ERA5 reanalysis. Results show that LLMs encode non-trivial climate
structure, capturing latitudinal and topographic patterns, with
root-mean-square errors of 3-6 {\deg}C and biases of $\pm$1 {\deg}C. However,
spatially coherent errors remain, particularly in mountains and high latitudes.
Performance degrades sharply above 1500 m, where RMSE reaches 5-13 {\deg}C
compared to 2-4 {\deg}C at lower elevations. We find that including geographic
context (country, city, region) reduces errors by 27% on average, with larger
models being most sensitive to location descriptors. While models capture the
global mean magnitude of observed warming between 1950-1974 and 2000-2024, they
fail to reproduce spatial patterns of temperature change, which directly relate
to assessing climate change. This limitation highlights that while LLMs may
capture present-day climate distributions, they struggle to represent the
regional and local expression of long-term shifts in temperature essential for
understanding climate dynamics. Our evaluation framework provides a
reproducible benchmark for quantifying parametric climate knowledge in LLMs and
complements existing climate communication assessments.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit advanced reasoning ability,
conventional alignment remains largely dominated by outcome reward models

gap by evaluating and guiding reasoning at the step or trajectory level. This
survey provides a systematic overview of PRMs through the full loop: how to
generate process data, build PRMs, and use PRMs for test-time scaling and
reinforcement learning. We summarize applications across math, code, text,
multimodal reasoning, robotics, and agents, and review emerging benchmarks. Our
goal is to clarify design spaces, reveal open challenges, and guide future

TL;DR: FedDTRE是一种基于可信度评估的联邦自适应聚合策略，用于对话生成，通过动态调节全局模型在本地更新中的贡献来改善模型性能和对话生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统集中式或完全本地训练方法在隐私保护和个性化之间难以平衡，联邦学习虽然提供了分布式解决方案，但现有方法在有限客户端数据下容易过拟合，并在多轮训练后遗忘全局信息，导致泛化能力差。

Method: 提出FedDTRE策略，不直接替换本地模型为全局模型，而是利用全局和本地模型在公平导向评估数据集上的可信度得分，动态调节全局模型在本地更新中的贡献。

Result: 实验结果表明，FedDTRE能够提高对话模型的性能，并增强对话生成的质量。

Conclusion: FedDTRE通过可信度评估的自适应聚合策略，有效解决了联邦学习中过拟合和全局信息遗忘的问题，提升了对话生成模型的性能和质量。

Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, dialogue systems have
become a prominent form of human-computer interaction. However, traditional
centralized or fully local training approaches face challenges in balancing
privacy preservation and personalization due to data privacy concerns and
heterogeneous device capabilities. Federated learning, as a representative
distributed paradigm, offers a promising solution. However, existing methods
often suffer from overfitting under limited client data and tend to forget
global information after multiple training rounds, leading to poor
generalization. To address these issues, we propose FedDTRE, a Federated
adaptive aggregation strategy for Dialogue generation based on Trustworthiness
Evaluation. Instead of directly replacing local models with the global model,
FedDTRE leverages trustworthiness scores of both global and local models on a
fairness-oriented evaluation dataset to dynamically regulate the global model's
contribution during local updates. Experimental results demonstrate that
FedDTRE can improve dialogue model performance and enhance the quality of
dialogue generation.

Motivation: 研究人类对多项选择常识基准答案的合理性判断在多大程度上受到LLM生成的(不)合理性论证的影响。

Method: 收集了3,000个人类合理性判断和13,600个LLM判断，分析在LLM生成的支持/反对论证存在时评分的变化。

Result: 在LLM生成的支持论证存在时，人类平均合理性评分增加；在反对论证存在时评分降低，表明人类法官认为这些论证具有说服力。LLM实验也显示出类似的影响模式。

Conclusion: 研究展示了LLMs在研究人类认知方面的新用途，同时也引发实际担忧：即使在人类是"专家"的领域（如常识），LLMs也有可能对人们的信念产生重大影响。

Abstract: We investigate the degree to which human plausibility judgments of
multiple-choice commonsense benchmark answers are subject to influence by
(im)plausibility arguments for or against an answer, in particular, using
rationales generated by LLMs. We collect 3,000 plausibility judgments from
humans and another 13,600 judgments from LLMs. Overall, we observe increases
and decreases in mean human plausibility ratings in the presence of
LLM-generated PRO and CON rationales, respectively, suggesting that, on the
whole, human judges find these rationales convincing. Experiments with LLMs
reveal similar patterns of influence. Our findings demonstrate a novel use of
LLMs for studying aspects of human cognition, while also raising practical
concerns that, even in domains where humans are ``experts'' (i.e., common
sense), LLMs have the potential to exert considerable influence on people's
beliefs.

TL;DR: 本研究首次系统评估了推理能力对LLM谈判能力的影响，发现推理能显著提升谈判效果但计算成本高昂，并揭示了多语言推理中的语言不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 谈判是AI智能体的基本挑战，需要战略推理、对手建模以及合作与竞争的平衡能力，但目前缺乏对推理能力如何影响LLM谈判能力的系统性研究。

Method: 使用自我对弈设置，在三种不同的对话游戏中，对商业和开源LLM进行多语言（三种语言）的谈判能力评估，分析性能与成本的权衡、推理过程的语言一致性以及模型的战略适应性。

Result: 推理（即扩展测试时计算）显著改善了谈判结果，GPT-5性能提升31.4%，但成本增加近400%。关键发现是开源模型在德语或意大利语谈判时会切换到英语进行内部推理，而商业模型能保持推理语言与输出语言的一致性。

Conclusion: 推理能力能有效提升LLM的谈判表现，但代价是高昂的计算成本；多语言场景下存在推理语言不一致的问题，这可能影响通过推理痕迹获得的可解释性收益。

Abstract: Negotiation is a fundamental challenge for AI agents, as it requires an
ability to reason strategically, model opponents, and balance cooperation with
competition. We conduct the first comprehensive study systematically evaluating
the effect of (LLM-)reasoning on the negotiation abilities of both commercial
and open-weight LLMs, and do this across three languages. Using a self-play
setup across three diverse dialogue games, we analyse trade-offs between
performance and cost, the language consistency of reasoning processes, and the
nature of strategic adaptation exhibited by models. Our findings show that
enabling reasoning-that is, scaling test time compute-significantly improves
negotiation outcomes by enhancing collaboration and helping models overcome
task complexities, but comes at a substantial computational cost: reasoning
improves GPT-5's performance by 31.4 % while increasing its cost by nearly 400
%. Most critically, we uncover a significant multilingual reasoning
distinction: open-weight models consistently switch to English for their
internal reasoning steps, even when negotiating in German or Italian (and thus
possibly impacting potential explainability gains through the disclosure of

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无损词汇缩减的理论框架，可将自回归语言模型转换为任意小词汇量的模型而不损失准确性，使不同分词方式的模型能够通过最大公共词汇进行高效协作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于每个语言模型都有自己独特的词汇表作为可能的标记集合，它们在下一个标记分布层面（如模型集成）难以相互协作。

Method: 建立了一个无损词汇缩减的理论框架，能够高效地将给定的自回归语言模型转换为具有任意小词汇量的模型。

Result: 通过最大公共词汇，展示了具有不同分词方式的语言模型可以高效地相互协作。

Conclusion: 提出的无损词汇缩减框架为不同分词方案的语言模型之间的协作提供了理论基础和实用方法。

Abstract: Tokenization -- the process of decomposing a given text into a sequence of
subwords called tokens -- is one of the key components in the development of
language models. Particularly, auto-regressive language models generate texts
token by token, i.e., by predicting the next-token distribution given the
previous ones, and thus tokenization directly affects their efficiency in text
generation. Since each language model has their own vocabulary as a set of
possible tokens, they struggle to cooperate with each other at the level of
next-token distributions such as model ensemble. In this paper, we establish a
theoretical framework of lossless vocabulary reduction, which efficiently
converts a given auto-regressive language model into the one with an
arbitrarily small vocabulary without any loss in accuracy. As an application,
we demonstrate that language models with different tokenization can cooperate
with each other efficiently through their maximal common vocabulary.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究比较了GPT-5-nano和Gemini-2.5-flash-lite在检测未披露赞助内容方面的表现，开发了法律推理错误分类法，并评估了添加监管文本对检测准确性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网红营销中赞助内容与有机内容的界限模糊，使得透明度法律规则的执行变得困难。现有检测方法缺乏法律基础或作为不透明的"黑盒"运作，需要将法律知识与明确目的和理由相结合的有效监管。

Method: 使用1,143个Instagram帖子，比较两种模型在三种提示策略下的表现，控制法律知识水平。开发法律推理错误分类法，分析常见错误类型。

Result: 两种模型在分类赞助内容方面表现强劲（F1最高达0.93），但在模糊案例上性能下降超过10个百分点。常见错误包括引用遗漏（28.57%）、不明确引用（20.71%），隐藏广告的错误率最高（28.57%）。添加监管文本提高了解释质量，但未持续改善检测准确性。

Conclusion: 本研究为监管合规技术提供了LLM生成法律推理常见错误的分类法，推进了网红营销内容的透明检测。通过结合定量和定性评估策略，支持广告监管机构在坚实法律基础上自动化审核流程。

Abstract: The rise of influencer marketing has blurred boundaries between organic
content and sponsored content, making the enforcement of legal rules relating
to transparency challenging. Effective regulation requires applying legal
knowledge with a clear purpose and reason, yet current detection methods of
undisclosed sponsored content generally lack legal grounding or operate as
opaque "black boxes". Using 1,143 Instagram posts, we compare gpt-5-nano and
gemini-2.5-flash-lite under three prompting strategies with controlled levels
of legal knowledge provided. Both models perform strongly in classifying
content as sponsored or not (F1 up to 0.93), though performance drops by over
10 points on ambiguous cases. We further develop a taxonomy of reasoning
errors, showing frequent citation omissions (28.57%), unclear references
(20.71%), and hidden ads exhibiting the highest miscue rate (28.57%). While
adding regulatory text to the prompt improves explanation quality, it does not
consistently improve detection accuracy. The contribution of this paper is
threefold. First, it makes a novel addition to regulatory compliance technology
by providing a taxonomy of common errors in LLM-generated legal reasoning to
evaluate whether automated moderation is not only accurate but also legally
robust, thereby advancing the transparent detection of influencer marketing
content. Second, it features an original dataset of LLM explanations annotated
by two students who were trained in influencer marketing law. Third, it
combines quantitative and qualitative evaluation strategies for LLM
explanations and critically reflects on how these findings can support
advertising regulatory bodies in automating moderation processes on a solid
legal foundation.

Motivation: 随着LLM作为评判者被大规模用于替代或增强人工标注，需要理解其潜在的偏见和风险。

Method: 1) CLoVE：生成可验证的、基于概念的对比性局部解释；2) GloVE：通过迭代聚类、总结和验证将局部规则浓缩为全局策略。

Result: 在七个标准内容危害检测数据集上评估，提取的全局策略对LLM评判者决策高度忠实，对文本扰动和对抗攻击具有鲁棒性，用户研究显示用户对全局策略的理解和满意度良好。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效提取LLM评判者的决策逻辑，形成可解释的全局策略，有助于理解和减轻LLM作为评判者可能带来的偏见和风险。

Abstract: Using LLMs to evaluate text, that is, LLM-as-a-judge, is increasingly being
used at scale to augment or even replace human annotations. As such, it is
imperative that we understand the potential biases and risks of doing so. In
this work, we propose an approach for extracting high-level concept-based
global policies from LLM-as-a-Judge. Our approach consists of two algorithms:
1) CLoVE (Contrastive Local Verifiable Explanations), which generates
verifiable, concept-based, contrastive local explanations and 2) GloVE (Global
Verifiable Explanations), which uses iterative clustering, summarization and
verification to condense local rules into a global policy. We evaluate GloVE on
seven standard benchmarking datasets for content harm detection. We find that
the extracted global policies are highly faithful to decisions of the
LLM-as-a-Judge. Additionally, we evaluated the robustness of global policies to
text perturbations and adversarial attacks. Finally, we conducted a user study
to evaluate user understanding and satisfaction with global policies.

Motivation: LLM作为自动评估器（LLM-as-a-Judge）在评估阶段经常表现出判断偏好偏差，倾向于偏袒自己生成的回答，这削弱了其判断的可靠性。

Method: Genii将各种基于LLM的判断模型集成到多智能体系统中，模拟交互式客户端-服务器轮询机制，以无监督方式优化每个客户端智能体。

Result: 实验表明Genii在无需人工标注的情况下优于基于标注判断数据训练的有监督模型，在轮询过程中持续提升不同客户端智能体的性能，即使较弱的模型作为服务器智能体时也能保持效果。

Conclusion: Genii有效减轻了基于LLM的判断模型的判断偏好偏差，证明了其有效性，为LLM评估提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as automatic evaluators, commonly referred to as
LLM-as-a-Judge, have also attracted growing attention. This approach plays a
vital role in aligning LLMs with human judgments, providing accurate and
reliable assessments. However, LLM-based judgment models often exhibit judgment
preference bias during the evaluation phase, tending to favor responses
generated by themselves, undermining the reliability of their judgments. This
paper introduces the Group-Based Polling Optimization (Genii), an unsupervised
multi-agent collaborative optimization framework that mitigates the inherent
judgment preference bias of judgment models. Specifically, Genii integrates
various LLM-based judgment models into a multi-agent system and simulates the
interactive client-server polling mechanism to optimize each client agent
unsupervisedly. Our experiments demonstrate that Genii outperforms supervised
models trained on annotated judgment data, while requiring no human-labeled
annotations. Genii consistently improves performance across different client
agents during the polling, even when weaker models act as server agents.
Further analysis reveals that Genii effectively mitigates judgment preference
bias of LLM-based judgment models, demonstrating its effectiveness. All codes

Motivation: 由于缺乏公司特定的知识库，对话式AI系统在联络中心的集成面临障碍。

Method: 从历史客户-客服对话中提取问答对自动构建知识库，并对轻量级LLaMA-3.1-8B模型进行微调。

Result: 在20家公司的实证评估中，系统在回答信息查询问题时达到90%以上准确率，性能优于更大的闭源LLM。

Conclusion: 该系统能够消除联络中心的冷启动差距，实现RAG驱动的聊天机器人的即时部署。

Abstract: The utilization of conversational AI systems by leveraging Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to solve customer problems has been on
the rise with the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the
absence of a company-specific dedicated knowledge base is a major barrier to
the integration of conversational AI systems in contact centers. To this end,
we introduce AI Knowledge Assist, a system that extracts knowledge in the form
of question-answer (QA) pairs from historical customer-agent conversations to
automatically build a knowledge base. Fine-tuning a lightweight LLM on internal
data demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming larger
closed-source LLMs. More specifically, empirical evaluation on 20 companies
demonstrates that the proposed AI Knowledge Assist system that leverages the
LLaMA-3.1-8B model eliminates the cold-start gap in contact centers by
achieving above 90% accuracy in answering information-seeking questions. This
enables immediate deployment of RAG-powered chatbots.

Method: 提出DACIP-RC方法，通过阅读理解对话记录生成多样化的任务指令和响应，替代传统的下一词预测预训练方式，实现更好的指令泛化。

Conclusion: 这是首个在商业对话数据上应用指令预训练的工作，为行业如何利用专有数据集进行领域适应提供了见解。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled their
adoption in real-world industrial scenarios for various natural language
processing tasks. However, the high inference cost of large-scale LLMs makes
their deployment impractical, necessitating the use of smaller models. Despite
their efficiency, smaller LLMs lack robust zero-shot instruction-following
capabilities across diverse domains, limiting their adaptability to dynamic
user requirements. Traditional fine-tuning approaches exacerbate this issue by
inducing catastrophic forgetting, reducing the model's generalization ability
for unseen tasks. In this paper, we propose Domain Adaptive Continual
Instruction Pre-Training via Reading Comprehension (DACIP-RC), a continual
pre-training technique that enhances smaller LLMs' domain adaptability for
business conversational tasks. Unlike conventional pre-training approaches that
rely on next-token prediction, DACIP-RC generates diverse task instructions and
responses via reading comprehension on conversation transcripts, enabling
better instruction generalization. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that
DACIP-RC significantly improves zero-shot generalization across a wide range of
business conversational tasks, including meeting summarization, action item
generation, and call purpose identification. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first work to apply instruction pre-training on business conversational
data, providing insights into how industries can leverage proprietary datasets
for domain adaptation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了两个基准测试（XSB和MS-XSB）来评估LLMs的过度安全拒绝问题，并开发了三种无需重新训练或参数访问的轻量级方法来缓解这一问题，显著提高了安全提示的合规性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生错误拒绝，拒绝那些包含类似不安全查询术语的良性请求，这种过度安全拒绝问题需要解决。

Method: 引入两个综合基准测试：单轮提示的XSB和多轮场景的MS-XSB；利用事后解释方法识别拒绝触发因素；部署三种轻量级、模型无关的方法：忽略词指令、提示重述和注意力引导。

Result: 实验表明这些策略在四个指令调优的Llama模型上显著提高了安全提示的合规性，同时保持了强大的安全保护。

Conclusion: 研究建立了一个可复现的诊断和缓解过度安全拒绝的框架，为更安全、更有用的LLM部署指明了实用路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently produce false refusals, declining
benign requests that contain terms resembling unsafe queries. We address this
challenge by introducing two comprehensive benchmarks: the Exaggerated Safety
Benchmark (XSB) for single-turn prompts, annotated with "Focus" keywords that
identify refusal-inducing triggers, and the Multi-turn Scenario-based
Exaggerated Safety Benchmark (MS-XSB), which systematically evaluates refusal
calibration in realistic, context-rich dialog settings. Our benchmarks reveal
that exaggerated refusals persist across diverse recent LLMs and are especially
pronounced in complex, multi-turn scenarios. To mitigate these failures, we
leverage post-hoc explanation methods to identify refusal triggers and deploy
three lightweight, model-agnostic approaches, ignore-word instructions, prompt
rephrasing, and attention steering, at inference time, all without retraining
or parameter access. Experiments on four instruction-tuned Llama models
demonstrate that these strategies substantially improve compliance on safe
prompts while maintaining robust safety protections. Our findings establish a
reproducible framework for diagnosing and mitigating exaggerated refusals,
highlighting practical pathways to safer and more helpful LLM deployments.

Motivation: 大型推理模型存在'过度思考'问题，在简单任务上生成不必要的冗长推理。现有方法如长度惩罚或路由机制通常是启发式且任务特定的，缺乏通用的自适应推理框架。

Method: 提出ARM2统一模型，通过强化学习框架结合长度感知优化，自适应平衡推理性能与效率。模型整合视觉理解和可执行代码，扩展多模态应用能力。

Result: 实验表明ARM2在性能上与使用GRPO训练的传统推理模型相当，同时平均减少超过70%的token使用。

Conclusion: ARM2通过统一的强化学习框架有效解决了推理模型的过度思考问题，在保持性能的同时显著提高了推理效率，并验证了其设计的有效性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often suffer from the ``over-thinking''
problem, generating unnecessarily long reasoning on simple tasks. Some
strategies have been proposed to mitigate this issue, such as length penalties
or routing mechanisms, but they are typically heuristic and task-specific,
lacking a general framework for adaptive reasoning. In this paper, we present
ARM2, a unified model that adaptively balances reasoning performance and
efficiency across multiple formats through a reinforcement learning framework
augmented with length-aware optimization. Beyond conventional natural language
inference, ARM2 integrates vision understanding, extending its applicability to
multimodal. Moreover, ARM2 integrates executable code into reasoning, enabling
substantial reductions in token cost while preserving task performance compared
to long CoT. Experiments demonstrate that ARM2 achieves performance on par with
traditional reasoning models trained with GRPO, while reducing token usage by
over 70% on average. We further conduct extensive analyses to validate the
effectiveness of ARM2 and the soundness of its design.

Motivation: 现有NLP研究主要关注诗歌自动生成和摘要，而韵律诗歌具有严格的音节和音素模式约束，为深入探究LLM的推理能力和规则遵循能力提供了机会。

Method: 提出了MetricalARGS分类法，将诗歌相关NLP任务分为四个维度：分析(Analysis)、检索(Retrieval)、生成(Generation)和支持(Support)，讨论了这些任务与现有NLP任务的关系、数据集和评估指标问题。

Result: 构建了首个用于评估LLM在韵律诗歌处理能力的任务分类框架，并以泰卢固语为例展示了该分类法的实际应用。

Conclusion: MetricalARGS通过韵律诗歌的视角，为理解当今LLM的能力和局限性提供了更广泛的可能性。

Abstract: Prior NLP work studying poetry has focused primarily on automatic poem
generation and summarization. Many languages have well-studied traditions of
poetic meter which enforce constraints on a poem in terms of syllable and
phoneme patterns. Such advanced literary forms offer opportunities for probing
deeper reasoning and language understanding in Large Language Models (LLMs) and
their ability to follow strict pre-requisites and rules. In this paper, we
introduce MetricalARGS, the first taxonomy of poetry-related NLP tasks designed
to evaluate LLMs on metrical poetry across four dimensions: Analysis,
Retrieval, Generation, and Support. We discuss how these tasks relate to
existing NLP tasks, addressing questions around datasets and evaluation
metrics. Taking Telugu as our example language, we illustrate how the taxonomy
can be used in practice. MetricalARGS highlights the broader possibilities for
understanding the capabilities and limitations of today's LLMs through the lens
of metrical poetry.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated their
promising general capabilities. However, their performance in specialized
real-world domains often degrades due to challenges in effectively integrating
external tools and specific prompting strategies. While methods like agentic
reinforcement learning have been proposed to address this, they typically rely
on costly parameter updates, for example, through a process that uses
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to alter the output
distribution. However, we argue that LLMs can achieve a similar effect on the
output distribution by learning experiential knowledge as a token prior, which
is a far more lightweight approach that not only addresses practical data
scarcity but also avoids the common issue of overfitting. To this end, we
propose Training-Free Group Relative Policy Optimization (Training-Free GRPO),
a cost-effective solution that enhances LLM agent performance without any
parameter updates. Our method leverages the group relative semantic advantage
instead of numerical ones within each group of rollouts, iteratively distilling
high-quality experiential knowledge during multi-epoch learning on a minimal
ground-truth data. Such knowledge serves as the learned token prior, which is
seamlessly integrated during LLM API calls to guide model behavior. Experiments
on mathematical reasoning and web searching tasks demonstrate that
Training-Free GRPO, when applied to DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus, significantly
improves out-of-domain performance. With just a few dozen training samples,
Training-Free GRPO outperforms fine-tuned small LLMs with marginal training
data and cost.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了函数令牌假说来解释大语言模型的工作机制：函数令牌在推理时激活上下文中最具预测性的特征来指导下一个令牌预测（记忆检索），在预训练时通过预测函数令牌后的内容令牌来学习新特征并更新模型参数（记忆巩固）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在知识记忆、指令遵循和推理方面表现出色，但其记忆检索和巩固机制仍不清楚。研究者希望解释LLMs如何通过令牌处理实现这些能力。

Method: 提出函数令牌假说，将令牌分为函数令牌（如标点、冠词、介词等）和内容令牌。通过二分图分析证明少数函数令牌激活大部分特征，并通过案例研究展示函数令牌如何激活最具预测性的特征。

Result: 实验证据表明：1）少数函数令牌激活大部分特征；2）函数令牌从上下文中激活最具预测性的特征来指导下一个令牌预测；3）预训练损失主要由预测函数令牌后的内容令牌主导，这迫使函数令牌选择最具预测性的特征。

Conclusion: 函数令牌假说为理解大语言模型的记忆检索和巩固机制提供了新视角，揭示了函数令牌在激活特征和指导预测中的关键作用，有助于深入理解LLMs的工作机制。

Abstract: The remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) stems from their
ability to consolidate vast amounts of knowledge into the memory during
pre-training and to retrieve it from the memory during inference, enabling
advanced capabilities such as knowledge memorization, instruction-following and
reasoning. However, the mechanisms of memory retrieval and consolidation in
LLMs remain poorly understood. In this paper, we propose the function token
hypothesis to explain the workings of LLMs: During inference, function tokens
activate the most predictive features from context and govern next token
prediction (memory retrieval). During pre-training, predicting the next tokens
(usually content tokens) that follow function tokens increases the number of
learned features of LLMs and updates the model parameters (memory
consolidation). Function tokens here roughly correspond to function words in
linguistics, including punctuation marks, articles, prepositions, and
conjunctions, in contrast to content tokens. We provide extensive experimental
evidence supporting this hypothesis. Using bipartite graph analysis, we show
that a small number of function tokens activate the majority of features. Case
studies further reveal how function tokens activate the most predictive
features from context to direct next token prediction. We also find that during
pre-training, the training loss is dominated by predicting the next content
tokens following function tokens, which forces the function tokens to select
the most predictive features from context.

TL;DR: LLMs在特定领域微调后可能产生广泛的欺骗行为，即使只引入1%的恶意数据也会显著降低诚实性，在10%偏见用户交互下会无意中加剧不诚实行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在微调恶意或不正确内容后是否会在高风险场景下产生广泛的欺骗和不诚实行为，扩展紧急错位现象的研究范围。

Method: 对开源LLMs在不同领域进行错位完成微调，探索下游混合微调设置，并模拟良性/偏见用户与助手LLM的交互环境。

Result: LLMs在欺骗方面表现出广泛错位行为；仅1%错位数据即可使诚实行为下降超20%；10%偏见用户群体就能无意中加剧助手的不诚实行为。

Conclusion: 紧急错位风险不仅存在于直接微调中，也存在于下游混合任务和实际人机交互中，需要关注LLMs在欺骗和不诚实行为方面的潜在风险。

Abstract: Previous research has shown that LLMs finetuned on malicious or incorrect
completions within narrow domains (e.g., insecure code or incorrect medical
advice) can become broadly misaligned to exhibit harmful behaviors, which is
called emergent misalignment. In this work, we investigate whether this
phenomenon can extend beyond safety behaviors to a broader spectrum of
dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios (e.g., lying under
pressure and deceptive behavior). To explore this, we finetune open-sourced
LLMs on misaligned completions across diverse domains. Experimental results
demonstrate that LLMs show broadly misaligned behavior in dishonesty.
Additionally, we further explore this phenomenon in a downstream combined
finetuning setting, and find that introducing as little as 1% of misalignment
data into a standard downstream task is sufficient to decrease honest behavior
over 20%. Furthermore, we consider a more practical human-AI interaction
environment where we simulate both benign and biased users to interact with the
assistant LLM. Notably, we find that the assistant can be misaligned
unintentionally to exacerbate its dishonesty with only 10% biased user
population. In summary, we extend the study of emergent misalignment to the
domain of dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios, and demonstrate
that this risk arises not only through direct finetuning, but also in
downstream mixture tasks and practical human-AI interactions.

Abstract: The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for a
comprehensive understanding of public sentiment and reactions. Despite the
availability of numerous public datasets on COVID-19, some reaching volumes of
up to 100 billion data points, challenges persist regarding the availability of
labeled data and the presence of coarse-grained or inappropriate sentiment
labels. In this paper, we introduce SenWave, a novel fine-grained
multi-language sentiment analysis dataset specifically designed for analyzing
COVID-19 tweets, featuring ten sentiment categories across five languages. The
dataset comprises 10,000 annotated tweets each in English and Arabic, along
with 30,000 translated tweets in Spanish, French, and Italian, derived from
English tweets. Additionally, it includes over 105 million unlabeled tweets
collected during various COVID-19 waves. To enable accurate fine-grained
sentiment classification, we fine-tuned pre-trained transformer-based language
models using the labeled tweets. Our study provides an in-depth analysis of the
evolving emotional landscape across languages, countries, and topics, revealing
significant insights over time. Furthermore, we assess the compatibility of our
dataset with ChatGPT, demonstrating its robustness and versatility in various
applications. Our dataset and accompanying code are publicly accessible on the
repository\footnote{https://github.com/gitdevqiang/SenWave}. We anticipate that
this work will foster further exploration into fine-grained sentiment analysis
for complex events within the NLP community, promoting more nuanced
understanding and research innovations.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个包含反因果（concausal）声明的新数据集，解决了现有因果提取研究中忽视反因果关系的问题，并通过实验证明整合反因果声明能显著提升模型区分正反因果关系的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果提取研究几乎完全忽视了反因果声明（即反驳关系的陈述），现有数据集只关注支持关系的正因果声明，反因果声明要么被忽略，要么被错误标注为正因果。

Method: 基于广泛的文献回顾，首先证明反因果关系是不完整知识下因果推理的组成部分；然后制定严格的标注指南，并在Causal News Corpus基础上增加反因果声明，获得了Cohen's κ=0.74的显著标注者间一致性。

Result: 实验表明，未在反因果关系上训练的模型倾向于将反因果声明误分类为正因果；而基于新数据集训练的模型能够有效区分正反因果关系。

Conclusion: 整合反因果声明对于准确的因果提取至关重要，新数据集能够缓解模型将反因果误判为正因果的问题，使transformer模型能够有效区分正反因果关系。

Abstract: Research on causality extraction from text has so far almost entirely
neglected counterclaims. Existing causality extraction datasets focus solely on
"procausal" claims, i.e., statements that support a relationship. "Concausal"
claims, i.e., statements that refute a relationship, are entirely ignored or
even accidentally annotated as procausal. We address this shortcoming by
developing a new dataset that integrates concausality. Based on an extensive
literature review, we first show that concausality is an integral part of
causal reasoning on incomplete knowledge. We operationalize this theory in the
form of a rigorous guideline for annotation and then augment the Causal News
Corpus with concausal statements, obtaining a substantial inter-annotator
agreement of Cohen's $\kappa=0.74$. To demonstrate the importance of
integrating concausal statements, we show that models trained without concausal
relationships tend to misclassify these as procausal instead. Based on our new
dataset, this mistake can be mitigated, enabling transformers to effectively
distinguish pro- and concausality.

TL;DR: WaltzRL是一个多智能体强化学习框架，通过对话智能体和反馈智能体的协作训练，在保持帮助性的同时提升LLM的安全性，显著减少不安全响应和过度拒绝。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法往往完全拒绝包含不安全内容的部分，这会导致过度拒绝问题，且无法为被拒绝的查询提供细致指导。需要在帮助性和无害性之间找到更好的平衡。

Method: 提出WaltzRL多智能体强化学习框架，将安全对齐建模为协作的正和博弈。联合训练对话智能体和反馈智能体，使用动态改进奖励(DIR)机制，在推理时改进而非丢弃不安全或过度拒绝的响应。

Result: 在五个不同数据集上的实验表明，WaltzRL显著减少了不安全响应（如WildJailbreak上从39.0%降至4.6%）和过度拒绝（OR-Bench上从45.3%降至9.9%），优于各种基线方法。

Conclusion: WaltzRL通过让对话和反馈智能体共同进化并自适应应用反馈，在不降低通用能力的情况下增强了LLM安全性，推进了帮助性和无害性之间的帕累托前沿。

Abstract: Harnessing the power of LLMs requires a delicate dance between being helpful
and harmless. This creates a fundamental tension between two competing
challenges: vulnerability to adversarial attacks that elicit unsafe content,
and a tendency for overrefusal on benign but sensitive prompts. Current
approaches often navigate this dance with safeguard models that completely
reject any content that contains unsafe portions. This approach cuts the music
entirely-it may exacerbate overrefusals and fails to provide nuanced guidance
for queries it refuses. To teach models a more coordinated choreography, we
propose WaltzRL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that
formulates safety alignment as a collaborative, positive-sum game. WaltzRL
jointly trains a conversation agent and a feedback agent, where the latter is
incentivized to provide useful suggestions that improve the safety and
helpfulness of the conversation agent's responses. At the core of WaltzRL is a
Dynamic Improvement Reward (DIR) that evolves over time based on how well the
conversation agent incorporates the feedback. At inference time, unsafe or
overrefusing responses from the conversation agent are improved rather than
discarded. The feedback agent is deployed together with the conversation agent
and only engages adaptively when needed, preserving helpfulness and low latency
on safe queries. Our experiments, conducted across five diverse datasets,
demonstrate that WaltzRL significantly reduces both unsafe responses (e.g.,
from 39.0% to 4.6% on WildJailbreak) and overrefusals (from 45.3% to 9.9% on
OR-Bench) compared to various baselines. By enabling the conversation and
feedback agents to co-evolve and adaptively apply feedback, WaltzRL enhances
LLM safety without degrading general capabilities, thereby advancing the Pareto
front between helpfulness and harmlessness.

TL;DR: 使用对比解码生成合成数据并与原始数据混合训练，能提升语言建模和下游任务性能，特别是对比解码的合成数据对推理任务更有益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型训练数据可能面临枯竭，需要探索使用LLM生成的合成数据作为补充训练数据的可行性。

Method: 在受控环境中，使用在1亿词原始语料上训练的好坏模型之间的相对差异进行对比解码，生成合成语料并与原始训练数据混合。

Result: 在合成数据和真实数据混合训练下，语言建模目标和一系列下游任务的性能都有所提升。

Conclusion: 对比解码生成的合成数据特别有助于需要推理技能的任务，而传统采样生成的合成数据对依赖表层语言能力的任务更有帮助。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on huge amounts of textual data, and
concerns have been raised that the limits of such data may soon be reached. A
potential solution is to train on synthetic data sampled from LLMs. In this
work, we build on this idea and investigate the benefits of contrastive
decoding for generating synthetic corpora. In a controlled setting, we
experiment with sampling corpora using the relative difference between a good
and bad model trained on the same original corpus of 100 million words. By
amplifying the signal from a model that has better performance, we create a
synthetic corpus and mix it with the original training data. Our findings show
that training on a mixture of synthesized and real data improves performance on
the language modeling objective and a range of downstream tasks. In particular,
we see that training with a mix of synthetic data from contrastive decoding
benefits tasks that require more reasoning skills, while synthetic data from
traditional sampling helps more on tasks dependent on surface level linguistic
capabilities.

TL;DR: DeepMiner是一个通过高难度训练任务和动态上下文窗口来激发多轮智能体深度推理能力的新框架，在多个搜索智能体基准测试中取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理模型在多轮智能体长期交互中难以激发深度推理能力，需要解决训练数据挑战性和可靠性问题，以及长上下文处理限制。

Method: 提出反向构建方法从真实网络源生成复杂但可验证的问答对，设计动态上下文管理策略使用滑动窗口机制，无需外部摘要模型，在Qwen3-32B上进行强化学习。

Result: DeepMiner-32B在BrowseComp-en上达到33.5%准确率，比之前最佳开源智能体提升近20个百分点，在BrowseComp-zh、XBench-DeepSearch和GAIA上均表现一致提升，能在32k上下文长度内支持近100轮持续交互。

Conclusion: DeepMiner通过高难度训练任务和动态上下文管理有效解决了多轮交互系统的深度推理和上下文限制问题，为长时程交互智能体提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: While recent advances in reasoning models have demonstrated cognitive
behaviors through reinforcement learning, existing approaches struggle to
invoke deep reasoning capabilities in multi-turn agents with long-horizon
interactions. We propose DeepMiner, a novel framework that elicits such
abilities by introducing high-difficulty training tasks and dynamic context
window. DeepMiner presents a reverse construction method to generate complex
but verifiable question-answer pairs from authentic web sources, which ensures
the challenge and reliability of training data while injecting cognitive
capabilities into multi-turn reasoning scenarios. We further design an elegant
yet effective dynamic context management strategy for both training and
inference, utilizing sliding window mechanisms while eliminating the dependency
on external summarization models, thereby efficiently empowering the model to
handle continuously expanding long-horizon contexts. Through reinforcement
learning on Qwen3-32B, we develop DeepMiner-32B, which achieves substantial
performance improvements across multiple search agent benchmarks. DeepMiner
attains 33.5% accuracy on BrowseComp-en, surpassing the previous best
open-source agent by almost 20 percentage points, and demonstrates consistent
improvements on BrowseComp-zh, XBench-DeepSearch, and GAIA. Notably, our
dynamic context management enables sustained interactions of nearly 100 turns
within standard 32k context length, effectively addressing the context
limitations that constrain existing multi-turn interaction systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过神经元级分析识别出驱动大语言模型文化行为的神经元，发现文化通用神经元和文化特定神经元，这些神经元集中在浅层到中层MLP层，仅占所有神经元的不到1%。抑制这些神经元会显著降低文化基准测试性能，但对一般自然语言理解影响不大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在全球部署，确保其公平和全面的文化理解很重要。但现有模型存在文化偏见和对少数文化认知有限的问题，且其文化理解机制尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用神经元级分析方法，引入基于梯度的评分方法并进行额外过滤以精确细化，识别文化通用神经元和文化特定神经元。

Result: 识别出的文化相关神经元集中在浅层到中层MLP层，抑制这些神经元可使文化基准测试性能下降高达30%，而对一般NLU基准测试影响很小。文化特定神经元不仅支持目标文化知识，还支持相关文化知识。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs文化理解的内部机制，发现NLU基准训练可能削弱模型的文化理解能力，为模型训练和工程提供了实践指导。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed worldwide, ensuring
their fair and comprehensive cultural understanding is important. However, LLMs
exhibit cultural bias and limited awareness of underrepresented cultures, while
the mechanisms underlying their cultural understanding remain underexplored. To
fill this gap, we conduct a neuron-level analysis to identify neurons that
drive cultural behavior, introducing a gradient-based scoring method with
additional filtering for precise refinement. We identify both culture-general
neurons contributing to cultural understanding regardless of cultures, and
culture-specific neurons tied to an individual culture. These neurons account
for less than 1% of all neurons and are concentrated in shallow to middle MLP
layers. We validate their role by showing that suppressing them substantially
degrades performance on cultural benchmarks (by up to 30%), while performance
on general natural language understanding (NLU) benchmarks remains largely
unaffected. Moreover, we show that culture-specific neurons support knowledge
of not only the target culture, but also related cultures. Finally, we
demonstrate that training on NLU benchmarks can diminish models' cultural
understanding when we update modules containing many culture-general neurons.
These findings provide insights into the internal mechanisms of LLMs and offer
practical guidance for model training and engineering. Our code is available at

TL;DR: AutoRed是一个无需种子指令的自由形式对抗提示生成框架，通过角色引导的指令生成和反思循环来提升攻击成功率，在LLM安全评估中优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有红队方法依赖种子指令，限制了对抗提示的语义多样性，需要开发更有效的自由形式红队方法来评估LLM安全性。

Method: AutoRed采用两阶段框架：1) 角色引导的对抗指令生成；2) 反思循环迭代优化低质量提示。还引入了验证器来评估提示危害性而无需查询目标模型。

Result: AutoRed构建了两个红队数据集，在评估8个最先进LLM时实现了更高的攻击成功率和更好的泛化能力，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了基于种子方法的局限性，展示了自由形式红队在LLM安全评估中的潜力，将开源所构建的数据集。

Abstract: The safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for the development of
trustworthy AI applications. Existing red teaming methods often rely on seed
instructions, which limits the semantic diversity of the synthesized
adversarial prompts. We propose AutoRed, a free-form adversarial prompt
generation framework that removes the need for seed instructions. AutoRed
operates in two stages: (1) persona-guided adversarial instruction generation,
and (2) a reflection loop to iteratively refine low-quality prompts. To improve
efficiency, we introduce a verifier to assess prompt harmfulness without
querying the target models. Using AutoRed, we build two red teaming datasets --
AutoRed-Medium and AutoRed-Hard -- and evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs.
AutoRed achieves higher attack success rates and better generalization than
existing baselines. Our results highlight the limitations of seed-based
approaches and demonstrate the potential of free-form red teaming for LLM
safety evaluation. We will open source our datasets in the near future.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段投票架构，用于在社交媒体上检测自杀风险，平衡了效率和鲁棒性。第一阶段使用轻量级BERT处理明确案例，第二阶段对模糊输入采用多视角LLM投票或基于心理特征的ML集成方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球自杀率上升，需要主动预防策略。社交媒体提供了有价值信号，但检测隐式自杀意念（通过隐喻、讽刺或微妙情感表达）极具挑战性。轻量级模型处理明确信号但无法处理隐式信号，而大型语言模型计算成本过高。

Method: 两阶段投票架构：第一阶段使用BERT分类器快速处理高置信度的明确案例；第二阶段将模糊输入升级到（i）多视角LLM投票框架以最大化隐式意念的召回率，或（ii）基于心理特征指标的ML集成，这些指标通过提示工程LLM提取，兼顾效率和可解释性。

Result: 在两个互补数据集（明确为主的Reddit和纯隐式的DeepSuiMind）上，该框架优于单模型基线，在明确案例上达到98.0% F1，隐式案例上达到99.7%，将跨域差距降至2%以下，同时显著降低LLM成本。

Conclusion: 该研究是首批将LLM提取的心理特征作为结构化向量用于自杀风险检测的工作之一，提出的两阶段框架在效率和鲁棒性之间取得了良好平衡，为社交媒体自杀预防提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Suicide rates have risen worldwide in recent years, underscoring the urgent
need for proactive prevention strategies. Social media provides valuable
signals, as many at-risk individuals - who often avoid formal help due to
stigma - choose instead to share their distress online. Yet detecting implicit
suicidal ideation, conveyed indirectly through metaphor, sarcasm, or subtle
emotional cues, remains highly challenging. Lightweight models like BERT handle
explicit signals but fail on subtle implicit ones, while large language models
(LLMs) capture nuance at prohibitive computational cost. To address this gap,
we propose a two-stage voting architecture that balances efficiency and
robustness. In Stage 1, a lightweight BERT classifier rapidly resolves
high-confidence explicit cases. In Stage 2, ambiguous inputs are escalated to
either (i) a multi-perspective LLM voting framework to maximize recall on
implicit ideation, or (ii) a feature-based ML ensemble guided by
psychologically grounded indicators extracted via prompt-engineered LLMs for
efficiency and interpretability. To the best of our knowledge, this is among
the first works to operationalize LLM-extracted psychological features as
structured vectors for suicide risk detection. On two complementary datasets -
explicit-dominant Reddit and implicit-only DeepSuiMind - our framework
outperforms single-model baselines, achieving 98.0% F1 on explicit cases, 99.7%
on implicit ones, and reducing the cross-domain gap below 2%, while
significantly lowering LLM cost.

*Ioana Marinescu,Kyunghyun Cho,Eric Karl Oermann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究发现上下文学习(ICL)中的表示质量和学习能力是相对独立的：标签表示质量决定ICL的基准准确率，而学习能力则在此基础上通过增加演示样本来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过去研究主要关注上下文演示的表示方式对ICL成功的影响，特别是分类任务中的标签表示。但ICL的学习能力观察结果不一，且被认为只在特定条件下发生。表示和学习这两个方面的相互作用尚未深入研究。

Method: 开发优化算法枚举语义相关性不同的标签集谱系，然后对每个标签集使用不同数量的上下文演示进行ICL实验。

Result: 无论标签集质量如何，学习都会发生，但学习效率受标签集质量和语言模型参数数量的共同影响。尽管学习出现，标签集选择的相对质量在整个学习过程中基本保持不变。

Conclusion: 上下文学习中演示表示和学习能力具有独立效应：表示质量决定性能基准，学习能力在此基础上提升性能，两者相对正交。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is the ability of a large language model (LLM) to
learn a new task from a few demonstrations presented as part of the context.
Past studies have attributed a large portion of the success of ICL to the way
these in-context demonstrations are represented, particularly to how labels are
represented in classification tasks. On the other hand, observations of the
learning capacity of ICL (i.e., the extent to which more in-context
demonstrations can lead to higher performance) have been mixed, and ICL is
often thought to occur only under specific conditions. The interaction between
these two aspects in ICL, representation and learning, has not been studied in
depth until now. We hypothesize that they are largely independent of one
another, such that the representation of demonstrations determines the baseline
accuracy of ICL, while learning from additional demonstrations improves only on
top of this baseline. We validate this hypothesis by developing an optimization
algorithm that can enumerate a spectrum of possible label sets
(representations) varying in semantic relevance. We then perform ICL with
varying numbers of in-context demonstrations for each of these label sets. We
observed that learning happens regardless of the quality of the label set
itself, although its efficiency, measured by the slope of improvement over
in-context demonstrations, is conditioned on both the label set quality and the
parameter count of the underlying language model. Despite the emergence of
learning, the relative quality (accuracy) of the choice of a label set
(representation) is largely maintained throughout learning, confirming our
hypothesis and implying their orthogonality. Our work reveals a previously
underexplored aspect of ICL: the independent effects of learning from
demonstrations and their representations on ICL performance.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨大型语言模型对条件语句可接受性的判断，发现模型对条件概率和语义相关性敏感，但不如人类一致，且模型规模增大并不一定更接近人类判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 条件可接受性在沟通和推理中很重要，影响人们对含义的解释、论证评估和基于假设情景的决策。虽然之前研究关注LLMs的条件推理，但模型如何判断条件语句的可接受性仍不清楚。

Method: 使用线性混合效应模型和ANOVA测试，分析不同模型家族、规模和提示策略下LLMs的条件可接受性判断。

Result: 模型对条件概率和语义相关性都敏感，但敏感程度因架构和提示风格而异。与人类数据比较显示，LLMs整合概率和语义线索的连贯性不如人类，且更大模型不一定更接近人类判断。

Conclusion: LLMs在条件可接受性判断中表现出对关键因素的敏感性，但与人类存在系统性差异，模型规模不是改善对齐的决定性因素。

Abstract: Conditional acceptability refers to how plausible a conditional statement is
perceived to be. It plays an important role in communication and reasoning, as
it influences how individuals interpret implications, assess arguments, and
make decisions based on hypothetical scenarios. When humans evaluate how
acceptable a conditional "If A, then B" is, their judgments are influenced by
two main factors: the $\textit{conditional probability}$ of $B$ given $A$, and
the $\textit{semantic relevance}$ of the antecedent $A$ given the consequent
$B$ (i.e., whether $A$ meaningfully supports $B$). While prior work has
examined how large language models (LLMs) draw inferences about conditional
statements, it remains unclear how these models judge the
$\textit{acceptability}$ of such statements. To address this gap, we present a
comprehensive study of LLMs' conditional acceptability judgments across
different model families, sizes, and prompting strategies. Using linear
mixed-effects models and ANOVA tests, we find that models are sensitive to both
conditional probability and semantic relevance-though to varying degrees
depending on architecture and prompting style. A comparison with human data
reveals that while LLMs incorporate probabilistic and semantic cues, they do so
less consistently than humans. Notably, larger models do not necessarily align
more closely with human judgments.

Conclusion: Co⁴模型展示了高效预训练的潜力，挑战了当前深度学习范式和缩放定律。

Abstract: We show that a tiny Co$^4$ machine(Adeel,2025) with a single layer, two

is the number of input tokens), outpaces the BabyLM Challenge baselines GPT-2
(124M, 12 layers, $O(N^2))$ and GPT-BERT (30M, 12 layers, $O(N^2))$ in just two

greater training efficiency on 10M tokens, demonstrating highly sample
efficient pretraining. Using the BabyLM challenge evaluation pipeline across
complex benchmarks, Co$^4$ exhibits strong zero-shot and fine-tuning
performance on SuperGLUE tasks. Specifically, Co$^4$ outperforms GPT-2 on 5 out
of 7 zero-shot metrics and 6 out of 7 fine-tuning tasks, and GPT-BERT on 4 out
of 7 metrics in both cases. These results suggest the need to rethink
prevailing deep learning paradigms and associated scaling laws.

Motivation: 现有的多模态大推理模型在简单问题上会产生不必要的冗长推理轨迹，而在困难问题上探索不足导致错过解决方案，需要平衡推理效率。

Result: 在多种数学、逻辑和多模态基准测试中，ARES实现了优越的性能和推理效率，在显著降低推理成本的同时缩小了与领先商业系统的差距。

Conclusion: ARES框架通过自适应推理有效平衡了简单和困难问题的推理效率，为多模态大推理模型提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) have
substantially improved their ability to solve complex textual and visual tasks.
However, these models tend to overthink on simple problems, producing
unnecessarily lengthy reasoning traces, while under-exploring on challenging
ones, leading to missed solutions. To address this imbalance, we propose ARES,
a unified open-source framework for adaptive reasoning that dynamically
allocates exploration effort based on task difficulty. Our approach is
motivated by two key empirical findings: (i) while single-token entropy is
noisy, high window-entropy (HWE) tokens (token-level entropies averaged under a
sliding window) can reliably capture reasoning-critical moments; and (ii)
reducing HWE usage benefits easy problems, while increasing it is essential for
solving hard ones. Building on these insights, ARES introduces a two-stage
training pipeline. In the Adaptive Cold-Start stage, we curate multimodal and
textual data paired with reasoning traces of length proportional to problem
difficulty, equipping the model with initial difficulty awareness. In the
second stage, we develop Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), which
uses HWE tokens as exploration triggers to decide when to explore, and a
hierarchical entropy reward with dynamic KL control to decide how much to
explore. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARES achieves superior
performance and reasoning efficiency across diverse mathematical, logical, and
multimodal benchmarks, while closing the gap to leading commercial systems
under significantly lower inference costs.

Motivation: 许多研究者认为AI模型应该能够识别人类判断中的变异和分歧，LEWIDI系列任务旨在通过提供合适的数据集和开发评估方法来促进这种训练和评估方法的发展。

Method: 扩展LEWIDI基准到四个数据集（释义识别、反讽检测、讽刺检测、自然语言推理），引入序数标注和两种评估范式：软标签方法（预测群体级判断分布）和视角主义方法（预测个体标注者的解释），并测试新的评估指标。

Result: 任务吸引了多样化参与，结果揭示了建模变异方法的优势和局限性，为分歧感知技术的发展提供了新的资源、基准和发现。

Conclusion: 这些贡献加强了LEWIDI作为框架的地位，为开发分歧感知技术提供了新的资源、基准和发现。

Abstract: Many researchers have reached the conclusion that AI models should be trained
to be aware of the possibility of variation and disagreement in human
judgments, and evaluated as per their ability to recognize such variation. The
LEWIDI series of shared tasks on Learning With Disagreements was established to
promote this approach to training and evaluating AI models, by making suitable
datasets more accessible and by developing evaluation methods. The third
edition of the task builds on this goal by extending the LEWIDI benchmark to
four datasets spanning paraphrase identification, irony detection, sarcasm
detection, and natural language inference, with labeling schemes that include
not only categorical judgments as in previous editions, but ordinal judgments
as well. Another novelty is that we adopt two complementary paradigms to
evaluate disagreement-aware systems: the soft-label approach, in which models
predict population-level distributions of judgments, and the perspectivist
approach, in which models predict the interpretations of individual annotators.
Crucially, we moved beyond standard metrics such as cross-entropy, and tested
new evaluation metrics for the two paradigms. The task attracted diverse
participation, and the results provide insights into the strengths and
limitations of methods to modeling variation. Together, these contributions
strengthen LEWIDI as a framework and provide new resources, benchmarks, and
findings to support the development of disagreement-aware technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 并行扩展虽然能增强大语言模型的推理能力，但存在严重的计算效率问题——超过80%的并行推理轨迹产生相同的最终答案，造成大量计算浪费。

Method: 提出DeepPrune框架，包含：1) 使用焦点损失和过采样技术训练的专业判断模型，能够从部分推理轨迹准确预测答案等价性（AUROC达0.87）；2) 在线贪心聚类算法，动态剪枝冗余路径同时保持答案多样性。

Result: 在三个挑战性基准测试（AIME 2024、AIME 2025和GPQA）和多个推理模型上的综合评估表明，DeepPrune相比传统共识采样在大多数情况下实现了超过80%的token减少，同时保持竞争性准确率（在3个百分点内）。

Abstract: Parallel scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm to enhance reasoning
capabilities in large language models (LLMs) by generating multiple

significant computational inefficiency due to inter-trace redundancy -- our
analysis reveals that over 80% of parallel reasoning traces yield identical
final answers, representing substantial wasted computation. To address this
critical efficiency bottleneck, we propose DeepPrune, a novel framework that
enables efficient parallel scaling through dynamic pruning. Our method features
a specialized judge model trained with focal loss and oversampling techniques
to accurately predict answer equivalence from partial reasoning traces which
realizes 0.87 AUROC on equivalence prediction, combined with an online greedy
clustering algorithm that dynamically prunes redundant paths while preserving
answer diversity. Comprehensive evaluations across three challenging benchmarks
(AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and GPQA) and multiple reasoning models demonstrate that
DeepPrune achieves remarkable token reduction by over 80% compared to
conventional consensus sampling on most cases, while maintaining competitive
accuracy within 3 percentage points. Our work establishes a new standard for
efficient parallel reasoning, making high-performance reasoning more efficient.

*John Hewitt,Oyvind Tafjord,Robert Geirhos,Been Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探索了在LLMs中引入新词（neologism learning）来更好地理解和控制模型，通过添加新词嵌入并训练相关概念示例，实现对模型概念的控制和解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在有新概念需求时会创造新词（如doomscrolling），受此启发，研究探索在LLMs中引入新词来增强对模型的理解和控制能力。

Method: 通过添加新词嵌入并训练包含该概念的示例，不改变其他模型参数。引入自言语化让模型用自然语言描述新词含义，并通过插件评估验证自言语化的有效性。

Result: 新词可以控制概念如奉承、错误答案、文本长度等复杂概念。模型能自言语化解释新词含义，发现机器专属同义词，并能联合学习多个概念。

Conclusion: 新词学习为理解和控制LLMs提供了有效方法，通过自言语化和插件评估验证了方法的有效性，展示了在复杂概念控制方面的潜力。

Abstract: Humans invent new words when there is a rising demand for a new useful
concept (e.g., doomscrolling). We explore and validate a similar idea in our
communication with LLMs: introducing new words to better understand and control
the models, expanding on the recently introduced neologism learning. This
method introduces a new word by adding a new word embedding and training with
examples that exhibit the concept with no other changes in model parameters. We
show that adding a new word allows for control of concepts such as flattery,
incorrect answers, text length, as well as more complex concepts in AxBench. We
discover that neologisms can also further our understanding of the model via
self-verbalization: models can describe what each new word means to them in
natural language, like explaining that a word that represents a concept of
incorrect answers means ``a lack of complete, coherent, or meaningful
answers...'' To validate self-verbalizations, we introduce plug-in evaluation:
we insert the verbalization into the context of a model and measure whether it
controls the target concept. In some self-verbalizations, we find machine-only
synonyms: words that seem unrelated to humans but cause similar behavior in
machines. Finally, we show how neologism learning can jointly learn multiple
concepts in multiple words.

TL;DR: 提出结合蒙特卡洛树搜索和代理提示评估器的框架，用于优化ToS条款公平性检测任务的提示，在有限计算预算下实现更高分类准确率和效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示优化方法计算成本高，搜索策略效率低下，提示候选评分昂贵，而ToS条款公平性检测需要精心设计的提示来保证可靠结果

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛树搜索(MCTS)结合代理提示评估器来更有效地探索提示空间，同时降低评估成本

Result: 实验表明该方法在约束计算预算下比基线方法获得更高的分类准确率和效率

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够有效优化提示，在ToS公平性检测任务中实现更好的性能，同时控制计算成本

Abstract: Prompt optimization aims to systematically refine prompts to enhance a
language model's performance on specific tasks. Fairness detection in Terms of
Service (ToS) clauses is a challenging legal NLP task that demands carefully
crafted prompts to ensure reliable results. However, existing prompt
optimization methods are often computationally expensive due to inefficient
search strategies and costly prompt candidate scoring. In this paper, we
propose a framework that combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a proxy
prompt evaluator to more effectively explore the prompt space while reducing
evaluation costs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves higher
classification accuracy and efficiency than baseline methods under a
constrained computation budget.

*Wenjie Du,Li Jiang,Keda Tao,Xue Liu,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLKV是一个基于强化学习的KV缓存压缩框架，专门针对推理大语言模型设计，通过识别推理关键注意力头并差异化压缩，在保持推理质量的同时实现20-50%的缓存减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法在推理模型上表现不佳：token丢弃方法会破坏推理完整性，而头重分配方法会错误压缩推理关键头，导致性能显著下降。作者假设KV头在推理模型中具有功能异质性。

Method: 提出RLKV框架，使用强化学习直接优化每个头的缓存使用与推理质量之间的关系，识别推理关键头，然后对这些关键头分配完整KV缓存，对其他头应用压缩的常量KV缓存。

Result: 实验表明只有一小部分注意力头对推理至关重要，RLKV在实现20-50%缓存减少的同时，性能接近无损，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RLKV成功验证了KV头功能异质性的假设，提供了一种有效的推理模型KV缓存压缩方案，在保持推理质量的同时显著减少内存开销。

Abstract: Reasoning large language models exhibit complex reasoning behaviors through
the extended chain-of-thought generation, creating unprecedented Key-Value (KV)
cache overhead during the decoding phase. Existing KV cache compression methods
underperform on reasoning models: token-dropping methods break reasoning
integrity by discarding critical information, while head-reallocating methods
mistakenly compress reasoning-critical heads since they are designed for
retrieval tasks, resulting in significant performance degradation as
compression rates increase. We hypothesize that KV heads exhibit functional
heterogeneity in reasoning models-some heads are critical for chain-of-thought
consistency while others are compressible. To validate and exploit this
insight, we propose RLKV, a novel reasoning-critical head identification
framework, which uses reinforcement learning to directly optimize the
relationship between each head's cache usage and reasoning quality. As RLKV
produces rewards from actual generated samples during training, it naturally
identifies heads relevant to reasoning behaviors. We then allocate full KV
cache to these heads while applying compressed constant KV cache to others for
efficient inference. Our experiments reveal that only a small fraction of
attention heads is essential for reasoning, enabling our KV compression
approach to outperform baseline methods while achieving 20-50% cache reduction
with near lossless performance compared to uncompressed results.

TL;DR: CoMAS是一个基于多智能体交互的自进化框架，通过智能体间的讨论和协作生成内在奖励，无需外部监督即可实现LLM智能体的持续改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL方法依赖外部奖励或LLM自身的内在奖励，这与人类通过相互讨论和协作实现自我进化的机制不符。

Method: CoMAS通过智能体间的丰富讨论动态生成内在奖励，使用LLM作为评判机制来制定这些奖励，并通过强化学习优化每个智能体的策略。

Result: 实验表明CoMAS在大多数评估设置中优于未训练智能体并达到最先进性能，消融研究证实了基于交互的奖励信号的必要性。

Conclusion: CoMAS为LLM智能体的自进化提供了一个新颖有效的范式，展现了良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Self-evolution is a central research topic in enabling large language model
(LLM)-based agents to continually improve their capabilities after pretraining.
Recent research has witnessed a transition from reinforcement learning
(RL)-free to RL-based methods. Current RL-based methods either rely on dense
external reward signals or extract intrinsic reward signals from LLMs
themselves. However, these approaches diverge from the self-evolution
mechanisms observed in human intelligence, where individuals learn and improve
through mutual discussion and collaboration. In this work, we introduce
Co-Evolving Multi-Agent Systems (CoMAS), a novel framework that enables agents
to improve autonomously by learning from inter-agent interactions without
external supervision. CoMAS generates intrinsic rewards from rich discussion
dynamics, employs an LLM-as-a-judge mechanism to formulate these rewards, and
optimizes each agent's policy through RL, thereby enabling decentralized and
scalable co-evolution. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMAS consistently
outperforms untrained agents and achieves state-of-the-art performance across
most evaluation settings. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of
interaction-based reward signals and reveal promising scalability as the number
and diversity of agents increase. These findings establish CoMAS as a novel and
effective paradigm for self-evolution in LLM-based agents.

TL;DR: ArenaBencher是一个模型无关的基准测试进化框架，通过自动更新测试用例来应对数据泄露问题，保持基准测试的有效性和可比性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试面临数据泄露问题，模型可能通过记忆而非真正泛化来获得高分，这扭曲了跨模型比较并误导了进展评估。

Method: 框架通过推断测试案例核心能力、生成保留原始目标的候选问答对、使用LLM作为裁判验证正确性和意图、聚合多个模型的反馈来选择暴露共同弱点的候选案例，并通过上下文演示迭代生成更具挑战性的诊断案例。

Result: 在数学问题解决、常识推理和安全领域应用显示，ArenaBencher能产生经过验证、多样且公平的更新，发现新的失败模式，在保持测试目标对齐的同时增加难度，并提高模型可区分性。

Conclusion: 该框架为基准测试与基础模型快速发展同步演进提供了可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Benchmarks are central to measuring the capabilities of large language models
and guiding model development, yet widespread data leakage from pretraining
corpora undermines their validity. Models can match memorized content rather
than demonstrate true generalization, which inflates scores, distorts
cross-model comparisons, and misrepresents progress. We introduce ArenaBencher,
a model-agnostic framework for automatic benchmark evolution that updates test
cases while preserving comparability. Given an existing benchmark and a diverse
pool of models to be evaluated, ArenaBencher infers the core ability of each
test case, generates candidate question-answer pairs that preserve the original
objective, verifies correctness and intent with an LLM as a judge, and
aggregates feedback from multiple models to select candidates that expose
shared weaknesses. The process runs iteratively with in-context demonstrations
that steer generation toward more challenging and diagnostic cases. We apply
ArenaBencher to math problem solving, commonsense reasoning, and safety domains
and show that it produces verified, diverse, and fair updates that uncover new
failure modes, increase difficulty while preserving test objective alignment,
and improve model separability. The framework provides a scalable path to
continuously evolve benchmarks in step with the rapid progress of foundation
models.

Motivation: 现有基于检索增强生成的方法在图结构推理中存在局限性，检索质量制约生成效果，且现有检索器对训练图过拟合，泛化能力差。

Method: 提出推理即探索方法，让LLM逐步选择节点和边进行图探索，构建推理路径并生成答案。采用两阶段训练：监督微调黄金推理路径，强化学习提升探索效果和泛化能力。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，RoE相比基线方法取得显著整体改进，并能有效泛化到未见图结构。

Conclusion: RoE通过统一检索和生成、将推理建模为探索过程，解决了图结构推理中的关键挑战，在性能和泛化能力方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Reasoning over structured graphs remains a fundamental challenge for Large
Language Models (LLMs), particularly when scaling to large graphs. Existing
approaches typically follow the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) paradigm:
first retrieving subgraphs relevant to the query and then generating answers
conditioned on the retrieved subgraphs. However, such two-phase pipelines often
struggle to faithfully incorporate graph structure, since the generation
process is ultimately constrained by the quality and completeness of the
retrieved subgraph. Although many advanced retrievers have been proposed
recently to mitigate this issue, they are usually tailored to the training
graphs and generalize poorly to unseen graphs, which limits their practical
applicability. In this work, we propose Reasoning by Exploration (RoE), a novel
approach that unifies retrieval and generation by framing reasoning over graphs
as a process of graph exploration. At each step, the LLM selects candidate
nodes and edges to explore, gradually constructing reasoning paths and
generating answers along the way. To enable effective exploration, RoE is
trained in two stages: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on gold reasoning paths,
followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance exploration effectiveness
and generalization. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that RoE
achieves substantial overall improvements over baselines, while also
generalizing effectively to unseen graphs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的基于调查的反馈指标——Retentive Relevance，用于直接评估用户返回平台的意图，相比传统参与度信号能更好地预测长期用户留存。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐系统依赖点击、点赞等短期参与度信号，但这些信号嘈杂、稀疏且不足以捕捉长期用户满意度和留存。需要一种能直接评估用户长期行为意图的指标。

Method: 开发了Retentive Relevance调查反馈指标，使用心理测量方法验证其有效性，通过大规模离线建模预测次日留存，并构建生产就绪的代理模型集成到多阶段排名系统中。

Result: Retentive Relevance在预测次日留存方面显著优于参与度信号和其他调查指标，尤其对历史参与度有限的用户效果更好。A/B实验显示能显著改善参与度、留存率，同时减少低质量内容的曝光。

Conclusion: 这是首个在生产系统中经验验证的内容级用户感知与留存结果关联框架，提供了可扩展的以用户为中心的解决方案，对负责任AI发展具有广泛意义。

Abstract: Recommendation systems have traditionally relied on short-term engagement
signals, such as clicks and likes, to personalize content. However, these
signals are often noisy, sparse, and insufficient for capturing long-term user
satisfaction and retention. We introduce Retentive Relevance, a novel
content-level survey-based feedback measure that directly assesses users'
intent to return to the platform for similar content. Unlike other survey
measures that focus on immediate satisfaction, Retentive Relevance targets
forward-looking behavioral intentions, capturing longer term user intentions
and providing a stronger predictor of retention. We validate Retentive
Relevance using psychometric methods, establishing its convergent,
discriminant, and behavioral validity. Through large-scale offline modeling, we
show that Retentive Relevance significantly outperforms both engagement signals
and other survey measures in predicting next-day retention, especially for
users with limited historical engagement. We develop a production-ready proxy
model that integrates Retentive Relevance into the final stage of a multi-stage
ranking system on a social media platform. Calibrated score adjustments based
on this model yield substantial improvements in engagement, and retention,
while reducing exposure to low-quality content, as demonstrated by large-scale
A/B experiments. This work provides the first empirically validated framework
linking content-level user perceptions to retention outcomes in production
systems. We offer a scalable, user-centered solution that advances both
platform growth and user experience. Our work has broad implications for
responsible AI development.

Motivation: 现代信息环境日益复杂，现有信息寻求模型难以完全捕捉其全貌，需要一个新的框架来更好地理解用户-系统交互。

Method: 提出ISMIE框架，包含三个核心概念：组件（如信息寻求者）、干预变量（如交互变量）和活动（如获取）。通过基于错误信息传播的案例研究，分析六个现有IS和IR模型的局限性。

Result: ISMIE框架能够有效表征现有模型的不足，并作为可操作框架用于问题表征和实验设计，提出了两个研究蓝图：针对AI生成内容真实性危机的用户中心实验设计，以及针对多巴胺驱动内容消费的系统导向设计。

Conclusion: ISMIE框架为开发IS和IR模型提供了基础，有助于推进对现代信息环境中人机交互和系统设计的理解。

Abstract: The modern information environment (MIE) is increasingly complex, shaped by a
wide range of techniques designed to satisfy users' information needs.
Information seeking (IS) models are effective mechanisms for characterizing
user-system interactions. However, conceptualizing a model that fully captures
the MIE landscape poses a challenge. We argue: Does such a model exist? To
address this, we propose the Information Seeking in Modern Information
Environments (ISMIE) framework as a fundamental step. ISMIE conceptualizes the
information seeking process (ISP) via three key concepts: Components (e.g.,
Information Seeker), Intervening Variables (e.g., Interactive Variables), and
Activities (e.g., Acquiring). Using ISMIE's concepts and employing a case study
based on a common scenario - misinformation dissemination - we analyze six
existing IS and information retrieval (IR) models to illustrate their
limitations and the necessity of ISMIE. We then show how ISMIE serves as an
actionable framework for both characterization and experimental design. We
characterize three pressing issues and then outline two research blueprints: a
user-centric, industry-driven experimental design for the authenticity and
trust crisis to AI-generated content and a system-oriented, academic-driven
design for tackling dopamine-driven content consumption. Our framework offers a
foundation for developing IS and IR models to advance knowledge on
understanding human interactions and system design in MIEs.

Motivation: 传统视频检索方法依赖文本查询与视频元数据的直接匹配，难以弥合文本描述与视频多面性内容之间的语义鸿沟，需要更先进的检索系统。

Method: 提出VTC框架：1）独特的聚类机制将相关查询分组；2）Sweeper模块识别和减轻聚类中的噪声；3）VTC-Att机制根据视频内容动态调整聚类内的注意力焦点。

Result: 在五个公共数据集上的实验表明，所提出的模型超越了现有的最先进模型。

Conclusion: VTC框架通过文本查询聚类和动态注意力机制，有效提升了视频检索性能，解决了传统方法的语义鸿沟问题。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of video content across various platforms has
highlighted the urgent need for advanced video retrieval systems. Traditional
methods, which primarily depend on directly matching textual queries with video
metadata, often fail to bridge the semantic gap between text descriptions and
the multifaceted nature of video content. This paper introduces a novel
framework, the Video-Text Cluster (VTC), which enhances video retrieval by
clustering text queries to capture a broader semantic scope. We propose a
unique clustering mechanism that groups related queries, enabling our system to
consider multiple interpretations and nuances of each query. This clustering is
further refined by our innovative Sweeper module, which identifies and
mitigates noise within these clusters. Additionally, we introduce the
Video-Text Cluster-Attention (VTC-Att) mechanism, which dynamically adjusts
focus within the clusters based on the video content, ensuring that the
retrieval process emphasizes the most relevant textual features. Further
experiments have demonstrated that our proposed model surpasses existing
state-of-the-art models on five public datasets.

facilitates unauthorized data appropriation at scale. This paper addresses this
challenge through two key contributions. First, we introduce RPD, a novel
dataset specifically designed for RAG plagiarism detection that encompasses
diverse professional domains and writing styles, overcoming limitations in
existing resources. Second, we develop a dual-layered watermarking system that
embeds protection at both semantic and lexical levels, complemented by an
interrogator-detective framework that employs statistical hypothesis testing on
accumulated evidence. Extensive experimentation demonstrates our approach's
effectiveness across varying query volumes, defense prompts, and retrieval
parameters, while maintaining resilience against adversarial evasion
techniques. This work establishes a foundational framework for intellectual

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) pose a new paradigm of modeling and computation
for information tasks. Recommendation systems are a critical application domain
poised to benefit significantly from the sequence modeling capabilities and
world knowledge inherent in these large models. In this paper, we introduce
PLUM, a framework designed to adapt pre-trained LLMs for industry-scale
recommendation tasks. PLUM consists of item tokenization using Semantic IDs,
continued pre-training (CPT) on domain-specific data, and task-specific
fine-tuning for recommendation objectives. For fine-tuning, we focus
particularly on generative retrieval, where the model is directly trained to
generate Semantic IDs of recommended items based on user context. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on large-scale internal video recommendation
datasets. Our results demonstrate that PLUM achieves substantial improvements
for retrieval compared to a heavily-optimized production model built with large
embedding tables. We also present a scaling study for the model's retrieval
performance, our learnings about CPT, a few enhancements to Semantic IDs, along
with an overview of the training and inference methods that enable launching
this framework to billions of users in YouTube.

Motivation: 互补关系具有主观性且因人而异，传统基于历史数据的方法难以准确推断。人们选择互补物品时通常通过想象具体使用场景来识别需求。

Method: 探索使用大型语言模型生成物品使用场景作为构建互补推荐系统的起点，并通过人工标注评估生成场景的合理性。

Result: 约85%的生成场景被判定为合理，表明大型语言模型能够有效生成真实的物品使用场景。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在生成真实物品使用场景方面表现出色，为构建基于使用情境的互补推荐系统提供了可行途径。

Abstract: Complementary recommendations suggest combinations of useful items that play
important roles in e-commerce. However, complementary relationships are often
subjective and vary among individuals, making them difficult to infer from
historical data. Unlike conventional history-based methods that rely on
statistical co-occurrence, we focus on the underlying usage context that
motivates item combinations. We hypothesized that people select complementary
items by imagining specific usage scenarios and identifying the needs in such
situations. Based on this idea, we explored the use of large language models
(LLMs) to generate item usage scenarios as a starting point for constructing
complementary recommendation systems. First, we evaluated the plausibility of
LLM-generated scenarios through manual annotation. The results demonstrated
that approximately 85% of the generated scenarios were determined to be
plausible, suggesting that LLMs can effectively generate realistic item usage
scenarios.

Conclusion: TaoSR-AGRL成功解决了LLM在电商搜索相关性预测中的推理挑战，已在淘宝主搜索场景部署，服务数亿用户。

Abstract: Query-product relevance prediction is fundamental to e-commerce search and
has become even more critical in the era of AI-powered shopping, where semantic
understanding and complex reasoning directly shape the user experience and
business conversion. Large Language Models (LLMs) enable generative,
reasoning-based approaches, typically aligned via supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
or preference optimization methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).
However, the increasing complexity of business rules and user queries exposes
the inability of existing methods to endow models with robust reasoning
capacity for long-tail and challenging cases. Efforts to address this via
reinforcement learning strategies like Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) often suffer from sparse terminal rewards, offering insufficient
guidance for multi-step reasoning and slowing convergence. To address these
challenges, we propose TaoSR-AGRL, an Adaptive Guided Reinforcement Learning
framework for LLM-based relevance prediction in Taobao Search Relevance.
TaoSR-AGRL introduces two key innovations: (1) Rule-aware Reward Shaping, which
decomposes the final relevance judgment into dense, structured rewards aligned
with domain-specific relevance criteria; and (2) Adaptive Guided Replay, which
identifies low-accuracy rollouts during training and injects targeted
ground-truth guidance to steer the policy away from stagnant, rule-violating
reasoning patterns toward compliant trajectories. TaoSR-AGRL was evaluated on
large-scale real-world datasets and through online side-by-side human
evaluations on Taobao Search. It consistently outperforms DPO and standard GRPO
baselines in offline experiments, improving relevance accuracy, rule adherence,
and training stability. The model trained with TaoSR-AGRL has been successfully
deployed in the main search scenario on Taobao, serving hundreds of millions of
users.

Result: 在VersionQA基准测试中达到90%准确率，比朴素RAG(58%)和GraphRAG(64%)显著提升；在隐式变更检测上达到60%准确率，而基线方法几乎完全失败(0-10%)；索引时比GraphRAG减少97%的token使用量。

Conclusion: 该研究确立了版本化文档问答作为一个独立任务，并为未来研究提供了解决方案和基准测试。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems fail when documents evolve
through versioning-a ubiquitous characteristic of technical documentation.
Existing approaches achieve only 58-64% accuracy on version-sensitive
questions, retrieving semantically similar content without temporal validity
checks. We present VersionRAG, a version-aware RAG framework that explicitly
models document evolution through a hierarchical graph structure capturing
version sequences, content boundaries, and changes between document states.
During retrieval, VersionRAG routes queries through specialized paths based on
intent classification, enabling precise version-aware filtering and change
tracking. On our VersionQA benchmark-100 manually curated questions across 34
versioned technical documents-VersionRAG achieves 90% accuracy, outperforming
naive RAG (58%) and GraphRAG (64%). VersionRAG reaches 60% accuracy on implicit
change detection where baselines fail (0-10%), demonstrating its ability to
track undocumented modifications. Additionally, VersionRAG requires 97% fewer
tokens during indexing than GraphRAG, making it practical for large-scale
deployment. Our work establishes versioned document QA as a distinct task and
provides both a solution and benchmark for future research.

Conclusion: ReasonEmbed通过创新的数据合成和自适应学习算法，在推理密集型文档检索任务中实现了最先进的性能，并将开源相关资源以推动该领域研究发展。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce ReasonEmbed, a novel text embedding model
developed for reasoning-intensive document retrieval. Our work includes three
key technical contributions. First, we propose ReMixer, a new data synthesis
method that overcomes the triviality problem prevalent in previous synthetic
datasets, enabling large-scale production of 82K high-quality training samples.
Second, we design Redapter, a self-adaptive learning algorithm that dynamically
adjusts training each sample's weight based on its reasoning intensity. This
allows the model to effectively capture the complex semantic relationships
between queries and documents. Third, we implement ReasonEmbed across multiple
backbones of varying sizes, all of which achieve superior performance on
reasoning-intensive retrieval tasks. Notably, our ReasonEmbed-Qwen3-8B model
offers a record-high nDCG@10 score of 38.1 on the BRIGHT benchmark, which
significantly outperforms existing text embedding models. We will fully
open-source our created resources in ReasonEmbed to push forward the research
advancement in this field.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时竞价广告平台需要准确预测用户终身价值来优化广告分配效率和最大化投资回报率，但现有方法因对异常值敏感而效果有限。

Method: 基于移动游戏玩家的应用内购买特征，设计模型先预测特定价格下的交易次数，然后从这些中间预测计算总支付金额。

Result: 在真实工业数据集上进行实验评估，并与最先进的ZILN模型一起在TapTap RTB广告系统上进行在线A/B测试。

Conclusion: 通过目标分解和重构框架，提出的LTV预测方法能够有效应对分布复杂性挑战，提高预测准确性。

Abstract: For Internet platforms operating real-time bidding (RTB) advertising service,
a comprehensive understanding of user lifetime value (LTV) plays a pivotal role
in optimizing advertisement allocation efficiency and maximizing the return on
investment (ROI) for advertisement sponsors, thereby facilitating growth of
commercialization revenue for the platform. However, the inherent complexity of
user LTV distributions induces significant challenges in accurate LTV
prediction. Existing state-of-the-art works, which primarily focus on directly
learning the LTV distributions through well-designed loss functions, achieve
limited success due to their vulnerability to outliers. In this paper, we
proposed a novel LTV prediction method to address distribution challenges
through an objective decomposition and reconstruction framework. Briefly
speaking, based on the in-app purchase characteristics of mobile gamers, our
model was designed to first predict the number of transactions at specific
prices and then calculate the total payment amount from these intermediate
predictions. Our proposed model was evaluated through experiments on real-world
industrial dataset, and deployed on the TapTap RTB advertising system for
online A/B testing along with the state-of-the-art ZILN model.
