Abstract: There is a substantial body of literature examining the mathematical
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
performance on precise arithmetic operations in autoregressive architectures.
However, their ability to perform approximate reasoning in informal, fast-paced
mathematical operations has received far less attention, especially among
non-autoregressive decoder models. Our work addresses this gap by introducing
StreetMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate models' approximation abilities
under real-world approximation scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations
across different LLM architectures: Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507,
Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507, Dream-v0-Instruct-7B, Falcon-Mamba-7B-Instruct, and
Mamba-GPT-3B. Furthermore, we apply mechanistic interpretability techniques to
probe their internal computational states. Our analysis reveals that LLMs
generally attempt to compute exact values or invoke external tools even in
tasks that call for approximation. Moreover, while models sometimes reach the
correct answer in early layers or steps, they still consume more tokens when
solving approximation tasks. Additional experiments indicate that exact and
approximate arithmetic operations rely on largely separate neural components.
Drawing upon research on cognitive psychology, we argue that LLMs do not
exhibit cognitive miserliness in the same way humans do in street math
settings. We open source our work https://github.com/ctseng777/StreetMath

Abstract: Opinion mining, also called sentiment analysis, is the field of study that
analyzes people opinions, sentiments, evaluations, appraisals, attitudes, and
emotions towards entities such as products, services, organizations,
individuals, issues, events, topics, and their attributes. Holistic
lexicon-based approach does not consider the strength of each opinion, i.e.,
whether the opinion is very strongly negative (or positive), strongly negative
(or positive), moderate negative (or positive), very weakly negative (or
positive) and weakly negative (or positive). In this paper, we propose approach
to rank entities based on orientation and strength of the entity reviews and
user's queries by classifying them in granularity levels (i.e. very weak, weak,
moderate, very strong and strong) by combining opinion words (i.e. adverb,
adjective, noun and verb) that are related to aspect of interest of certain
product. We shall use fuzzy logic algorithmic approach in order to classify
opinion words into different category and syntactic dependency resolution to
find relations for desired aspect words. Opinion words related to certain
aspects of interest are considered to find the entity score for that aspect in
the review.

Abstract: Stance detection has emerged as an area of research in the field of
artificial intelligence. However, most research is currently centered on the
target-dependent stance detection task, which is based on a person's stance in
favor of or against a specific target. Furthermore, most benchmark datasets are
based on English, making it difficult to develop models in low-resource
languages such as Korean, especially for an emerging field such as stance
detection. This study proposes the LArge-Scale Target-Independent STance
(LASTIST) dataset to fill this research gap. Collected from the press releases
of both parties on Korean political parties, the LASTIST dataset uses 563,299
labeled Korean sentences. We provide a detailed description of how we collected
and constructed the dataset and trained state-of-the-art deep learning and
stance detection models. Our LASTIST dataset is designed for various tasks in
stance detection, including target-independent stance detection and diachronic
evolution stance detection. We deploy our dataset on
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LASTIST-3721/.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed with task-specific
adapters catering to multiple downstream applications. In such a scenario, the
additional compute associated with these apparently insignificant number of
adapter parameters (typically less than 1% of the base model) turns out to be
disproportionately significant during inference time (upto 2.5x times that of
the base model). In this paper, we propose a new zero-latency fused low-rank
adapter (zFLoRA) that introduces zero or negligible latency overhead on top of
the base model. Experimental results on LLMs of size 1B, 3B and 7B show that
zFLoRA compares favorably against the popular supervised fine-tuning benchmarks
including low-rank adapters (LoRA) as well as full fine-tuning (FFT).
Experiments are conducted on 18 different tasks across three different
categories namely commonsense reasoning, math reasoning and summary-dialogue.
Latency measurements made on NPU (Samsung Galaxy S25+) as well as GPU (NVIDIA
H100) platforms show that the proposed zFLoRA adapters introduce zero to
negligible latency overhead.

Abstract: One of the main challenges in mechanistic interpretability is circuit
discovery, determining which parts of a model perform a given task. We build on
the Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark (MIB) and propose three key
improvements to circuit discovery. First, we use bootstrapping to identify
edges with consistent attribution scores. Second, we introduce a simple
ratio-based selection strategy to prioritize strong positive-scoring edges,
balancing performance and faithfulness. Third, we replace the standard greedy
selection with an integer linear programming formulation. Our methods yield
more faithful circuits and outperform prior approaches across multiple MIB
tasks and models. Our code is available at:

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Human experts often struggle to select the best option from a large set of
items with multiple competing objectives, a process bottlenecked by the
difficulty of formalizing complex, implicit preferences. To address this, we
introduce LISTEN, a framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) as a
zero-shot preference oracle, guided only by an expert's high-level priorities
in natural language. To operate within LLM constraints like context windows and
inference costs, we propose two iterative algorithms: LISTEN-U, which uses the
LLM to refine a parametric utility function, and LISTEN-T, a non-parametric
method that performs tournament-style selections over small batches of
solutions. Evaluated on diverse tasks including flight booking, shopping, and
exam scheduling, our results show LISTEN-U excels when preferences are
parametrically aligned (a property we measure with a novel concordance metric),
while LISTEN-T offers more robust performance. This work explores a promising
direction for steering complex multi-objective decisions directly with natural
language, reducing the cognitive burden of traditional preference elicitation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Long-context language models unlock advanced capabilities in reasoning, code
generation, and document summarization by leveraging dependencies across
extended spans of text. However, a significant portion of readily available
long-text data lacks meaningful long-distance dependencies; most spans can be
predicted using only local context. Training on such data is inefficient,
making careful data selection crucial. Therefore, we introduce LongFilter, a
framework for curating training data tailored to long-context pretraining.
LongFilter measures the information gain provided by extended context by
contrasting model predictions under long-context versus short-context settings,
thereby identifying samples where long-range dependencies are essential.
Experiments with LLaMA-3-8B, extending its context length from 8K to 64K, show
that LongFilter efficiently selects high-quality data and yields substantial
improvements on benchmarks such as HELMET, LongBench, and RULER.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in content moderation
systems, where ensuring fairness and neutrality is essential. In this study, we
examine how persona adoption influences the consistency and fairness of harmful
content classification across different LLM architectures, model sizes, and
content modalities (language vs. vision). At first glance, headline performance
metrics suggest that personas have little impact on overall classification
accuracy. However, a closer analysis reveals important behavioral shifts.
Personas with different ideological leanings display distinct propensities to
label content as harmful, showing that the lens through which a model "views"
input can subtly shape its judgments. Further agreement analyses highlight that
models, particularly larger ones, tend to align more closely with personas from
the same political ideology, strengthening within-ideology consistency while
widening divergence across ideological groups. To show this effect more
directly, we conducted an additional study on a politically targeted task,
which confirmed that personas not only behave more coherently within their own
ideology but also exhibit a tendency to defend their perspective while
downplaying harmfulness in opposing views. Together, these findings highlight
how persona conditioning can introduce subtle ideological biases into LLM
outputs, raising concerns about the use of AI systems that may reinforce
partisan perspectives under the guise of neutrality.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) store clinical documentation as base64
encoded attachments in FHIR DocumentReference resources, which makes semantic
question answering difficult. Traditional vector database methods often miss
nuanced clinical relationships. The Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval (CLEAR)
method, introduced by Lopez et al. 2025, uses entity aware retrieval and
achieved improved performance with an F1 score of 0.90 versus 0.86 for
embedding based retrieval, while using over 70 percent fewer tokens. We
developed a Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform to validate CLEAR against
zero shot large context inference and traditional chunk based retrieval
augmented generation. The platform was tested on 12 clinical notes ranging from
10,000 to 65,000 tokens representing realistic EHR content. CLEAR achieved a
58.3 percent win rate, an average semantic similarity of 0.878, and used 78
percent fewer tokens than wide context processing. The largest performance
gains occurred on long notes, with a 75 percent win rate for documents
exceeding 65,000 tokens. These findings confirm that entity aware retrieval
improves both efficiency and accuracy in clinical natural language processing.
The evaluation framework provides a reusable and transparent benchmark for
assessing clinical question answering systems where semantic precision and
computational efficiency are critical.

Abstract: Post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for unlocking their
task generalization potential and domain-specific capabilities. However, the
current LLM post-training paradigm faces significant data challenges, including
the high costs of manual annotation and diminishing marginal returns on data
scales. Therefore, achieving data-efficient post-training has become a key
research question. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey of
data-efficient LLM post-training from a data-centric perspective. We propose a
taxonomy of data-efficient LLM post-training methods, covering data selection,
data quality enhancement, synthetic data generation, data distillation and
compression, and self-evolving data ecosystems. We summarize representative
approaches in each category and outline future research directions. By
examining the challenges in data-efficient LLM post-training, we highlight open
problems and propose potential research avenues. We hope our work inspires
further exploration into maximizing the potential of data utilization in
large-scale model training. Paper List:

Abstract: The use of LLM-based applications as a means to accelerate and/or substitute
human labor in the creation of language resources and dataset is a reality.
Nonetheless, despite the potential of such tools for linguistic research,
comprehensive evaluation of their performance and impact on the creation of
annotated datasets, especially under a perspectivized approach to NLP, is still
missing. This paper contributes to reduction of this gap by reporting on an
extensive evaluation of the (semi-)automatization of FrameNet-like semantic
annotation by the use of an LLM-based semantic role labeler. The methodology
employed compares annotation time, coverage and diversity in three experimental
settings: manual, automatic and semi-automatic annotation. Results show that
the hybrid, semi-automatic annotation setting leads to increased frame
diversity and similar annotation coverage, when compared to the human-only
setting, while the automatic setting performs considerably worse in all
metrics, except for annotation time.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: If we cannot inspect the training data of a large language model (LLM), how
can we ever know what it has seen? We believe the most compelling evidence
arises when the model itself freely reproduces the target content. As such, we
propose RECAP, an agentic pipeline designed to elicit and verify memorized
training data from LLM outputs. At the heart of RECAP is a feedback-driven
loop, where an initial extraction attempt is evaluated by a secondary language
model, which compares the output against a reference passage and identifies
discrepancies. These are then translated into minimal correction hints, which
are fed back into the target model to guide subsequent generations. In
addition, to address alignment-induced refusals, RECAP includes a jailbreaking
module that detects and overcomes such barriers. We evaluate RECAP on
EchoTrace, a new benchmark spanning over 30 full books, and the results show
that RECAP leads to substantial gains over single-iteration approaches. For
instance, with GPT-4.1, the average ROUGE-L score for the copyrighted text
extraction improved from 0.38 to 0.47 - a nearly 24% increase.

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze.
Legal case documents offer critical insights but are often unstructured,
lexically dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, which pose
significant challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. While
recent LLM-based approaches improve over static templates, they still generate
noisy, fragmented graphs with duplicate nodes due to the absence of guided
extraction and coreference resolution. The recently proposed CORE-KG framework
addresses these limitations by integrating a type-aware coreference module and
domain-guided structured prompts, significantly reducing node duplication and
legal noise. In this work, we present a systematic ablation study of CORE-KG to
quantify the individual contributions of its two key components. Our results
show that removing coreference resolution results in a 28.32% increase in node
duplication and a 4.32% increase in noisy nodes, while removing structured
prompts leads to a 4.34% increase in node duplication and a 73.33% increase in
noisy nodes. These findings offer empirical insights for designing robust
LLM-based pipelines for extracting structured representations from complex
legal texts.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The impact of different multilingual data mixtures in pretraining large
language models (LLMs) has been a topic of ongoing debate, often raising
concerns about potential trade-offs between language coverage and model
performance (i.e., the curse of multilinguality). In this work, we investigate
these assumptions by training 1.1B and 3B parameter LLMs on diverse
multilingual corpora, varying the number of languages from 25 to 400. Our study
challenges common beliefs surrounding multilingual training. First, we find
that combining English and multilingual data does not necessarily degrade the
in-language performance of either group, provided that languages have a
sufficient number of tokens included in the pretraining corpus. Second, we
observe that using English as a pivot language (i.e., a high-resource language
that serves as a catalyst for multilingual generalization) yields benefits
across language families, and contrary to expectations, selecting a pivot
language from within a specific family does not consistently improve
performance for languages within that family. Lastly, we do not observe a
significant "curse of multilinguality" as the number of training languages
increases in models at this scale. Our findings suggest that multilingual data,
when balanced appropriately, can enhance language model capabilities without
compromising performance, even in low-resource settings

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) is widely employed to address resource scarcity in
low-resource languages by generating synthetic data from high-resource
counterparts. While sentiment preservation in translation has long been
studied, a critical but underexplored factor is the role of cultural alignment
between source and target languages. In this paper, we hypothesize that
semantic labels are drifted or altered during MT due to cultural divergence.
Through a series of experiments across culturally sensitive and neutral
domains, we establish three key findings: (1) MT systems, including modern
Large Language Models (LLMs), induce label drift during translation,
particularly in culturally sensitive domains; (2) unlike earlier statistical MT
tools, LLMs encode cultural knowledge, and leveraging this knowledge can
amplify label drift; and (3) cultural similarity or dissimilarity between
source and target languages is a crucial determinant of label preservation. Our
findings highlight that neglecting cultural factors in MT not only undermines
label fidelity but also risks misinterpretation and cultural conflict in
downstream applications.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning, where prose-based generation leads to unverified and arithmetically
unsound solutions. Current prompting strategies like Chain of Thought still
operate within this unreliable medium, lacking a mechanism for deterministic
verification. To address these limitations, we introduce SymCode, a
neurosymbolic framework that reframes mathematical problem-solving as a task of
verifiable code generation using the SymPy library. We evaluate SymCode on
challenging benchmarks, including MATH-500 and OlympiadBench, demonstrating
significant accuracy improvements of up to 13.6 percentage points over
baselines. Our analysis shows that SymCode is not only more token-efficient but
also fundamentally shifts model failures from opaque logical fallacies towards
transparent, programmatic errors. By grounding LLM reasoning in a deterministic
symbolic engine, SymCode represents a key step towards more accurate and
trustworthy AI in formal domains.

Abstract: AI accelerators, customized to AI workloads, provide cost-effective and
high-performance solutions for training and inference. Trainium, an AI
accelerator recently developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS), provides an
attractive option for LLM training and inference through its heterogeneous
architecture. However, leveraging Trainium architecture for high performance
can be challenging because of its systolic array architecture and special
requirement on data layout. In this paper, we design high-performance matrix
multiplication (matmul), a critical compute kernel, for LLM inference on
Trainium. We introduce a series of techniques customized to Trainium based on
kernel fusion and novel caching strategies to reduce data movement across the
software-managed memory hierarchy, maximize SRAM bandwidth, and avoid expensive
matrix transpose. Evaluating with nine datasets and four recent LLMs, we show
that our system largely outperforms the state-of-the-art matmul implemented by
AWS on Trainium: at the level of matmul kernel, it achieves an average 1.35x
speedup (up to 2.22x), which translates to an average 1.66x speedup (up to
2.49x) for end-to-end LLM inference.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in generative applications such
as chatting, code generation, and reasoning. However, many realworld workloads
such as classification, question answering, recommendation, and text embedding
rely solely on the prefill stage of inference, where the model encodes input
sequences without performing autoregressive decoding. In these prefill only
scenarios, the self-attention computation becomes the primary performance
bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length. In
this paper, we observe that semantically different sentences often produce
similar attention maps across layers and heads. Building on this insight, we
propose AttnCache, a framework that accelerates the prefill stage of LLM
inference by retrieving and reusing similar attention maps. Based on an
attention map memorization database, AttnCache employs efficient caching and
similarity search techniques to identify and reuse pre-cached attention maps
during inference, thereby reducing the computational overhead of
self-attention. Experimental results show that AttnCache achieves an average of
1.2x end-to-end and 2x attention speedup on CPU, and 1.6x end-to-end and 3x
attention speedup on GPU, with negligible accuracy degradation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with problems that require
multi-step reasoning. For small-scale open-source models, Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) fails when correct solutions are rarely
sampled even after many attempts, while Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to
overfit long demonstrations through rigid token-by-token imitation. To address
this gap, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a framework that
reformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical "actions". SRL
trains the model to generate an internal reasoning monologue before committing
to each action. It provides smoother rewards based on the similarity between
the model's actions and expert actions extracted from the SFT dataset in a
step-wise manner. This supervision offers richer learning signals even when all
rollouts are incorrect, while encouraging flexible reasoning guided by expert
demonstrations. As a result, SRL enables small models to learn challenging
problems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Moreover, initializing training
with SRL before refining with RLVR yields the strongest overall performance.
Beyond reasoning benchmarks, SRL generalizes effectively to agentic software
engineering tasks, establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework
for reasoning-oriented LLMs.

Abstract: Current tool-use large language models (LLMs) are trained on static datasets,
enabling them to interact with external tools and perform multi-step,
tool-integrated reasoning, which produces tool-call trajectories. However,
these models imitate how a query is resolved in a generic tool-call routine,
thereby failing to explore possible solutions and demonstrating limited
performance in an evolved, dynamic tool-call environment. In this work, we
propose PORTool, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that encourages a
tool-use LLM to explore various trajectories yielding the correct answer.
Specifically, this method starts with generating multiple rollouts for a given
query, and some of them share the first few tool-call steps, thereby forming a
tree-like structure. Next, we assign rewards to each step, based on its ability
to produce a correct answer and make successful tool calls. A shared step
across different trajectories receives the same reward, while different steps
under the same fork receive different rewards. Finally, these step-wise rewards
are used to calculate fork-relative advantages, blended with
trajectory-relative advantages, to train the LLM for tool use. The experiments
utilize 17 tools to address user queries, covering both time-sensitive and
time-invariant topics. We conduct ablation studies to systematically justify
the necessity and the design robustness of step-wise rewards. Furthermore, we
compare the proposed PORTool with other training approaches and demonstrate
significant improvements in final accuracy and the number of tool-call steps.

enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to seamlessly transfer knowledge across
languages. While intuitive, we hypothesize, this pursuit of representational
convergence can inadvertently cause "cultural erasure", the functional loss of
providing culturally-situated responses that should diverge based on the query
language. In this work, we systematically analyze this trade-off by introducing
a holistic evaluation framework, the transfer-localization plane, which
quantifies both desirable knowledge transfer and undesirable cultural erasure.
Using this framework, we re-evaluate recent CLA approaches and find that they
consistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural
localization across all six languages studied. Our investigation into the
internal representations of these models reveals a key insight: universal
factual transfer and culturally-specific knowledge are optimally steerable at
different model layers. Based on this finding, we propose Surgical Steering, a
novel inference-time method that disentangles these two objectives. By applying
targeted activation steering to distinct layers, our approach achieves a better
balance between the two competing dimensions, effectively overcoming the
limitations of current alignment techniques.

Abstract: Importance Incidental thyroid findings (ITFs) are increasingly detected on
imaging performed for non-thyroid indications. Their prevalence, features, and
clinical consequences remain undefined. Objective To develop, validate, and
deploy a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to identify ITFs in
radiology reports and assess their prevalence, features, and clinical outcomes.
Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort of adults without prior
thyroid disease undergoing thyroid-capturing imaging at Mayo Clinic sites from
July 1, 2017, to September 30, 2023. A transformer-based NLP pipeline
identified ITFs and extracted nodule characteristics from image reports from
multiple modalities and body regions. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of
ITFs, downstream thyroid ultrasound, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer
diagnosis. Logistic regression identified demographic and imaging-related
factors. Results Among 115,683 patients (mean age, 56.8 [SD 17.2] years; 52.9%
women), 9,077 (7.8%) had an ITF, of which 92.9% were nodules. ITFs were more
likely in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was
ordered by oncology or internal medicine. Compared with chest CT, ITFs were
more likely via neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans. Nodule
characteristics were poorly documented, with size reported in 44% and other
features in fewer than 15% (e.g. calcifications). Compared with patients
without ITFs, those with ITFs had higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis,
biopsy, thyroidectomy and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers were
papillary, and larger when detected after ITFs vs no ITF. Conclusions ITFs were
common and strongly associated with cascades leading to the detection of small,
low-risk cancers. These findings underscore the role of ITFs in thyroid cancer
overdiagnosis and the need for standardized reporting and more selective
follow-up.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been applied to automatic
programming code generation. This task can be viewed as a language generation
task that bridges natural language, human knowledge, and programming logic.
However, it remains underexplored in domains that require interaction with
hardware devices, such as quantum programming, where human coders write Python
code that is executed on a quantum computer. To address this gap, we introduce
QCoder Benchmark, an evaluation framework that assesses LLMs on quantum
programming with feedback from simulated hardware devices. Our benchmark offers
two key features. First, it supports evaluation using a quantum simulator
environment beyond conventional Python execution, allowing feedback of
domain-specific metrics such as circuit depth, execution time, and error
classification, which can be used to guide better generation. Second, it
incorporates human-written code submissions collected from real programming
contests, enabling both quantitative comparisons and qualitative analyses of
LLM outputs against human-written codes. Our experiments reveal that even
advanced models like GPT-4o achieve only around 18.97% accuracy, highlighting
the difficulty of the benchmark. In contrast, reasoning-based models such as o3
reach up to 78% accuracy, outperforming averaged success rates of human-written
codes (39.98%). We release the QCoder Benchmark dataset and public evaluation
API to support further research.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs), low diversity in model outputs often
becomes a bottleneck; this is partly caused by the common "one problem, one
solution" (1P1S) training practice, which provides a single canonical answer
and can push models toward a narrow set of reasoning paths. To address this, we
propose a "one problem, multiple solutions" (1PNS) training paradigm that
exposes the model to a variety of valid reasoning trajectories and thus
increases inference diversity. A core challenge for 1PNS is reliably measuring
semantic differences between multi-step chains of thought, so we introduce
Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD), a step-level metric that aligns and scores
Long Chain-of-Thought solutions to capture differences in intermediate
reasoning. Using RPD, we curate maximally diverse solution sets per problem and
fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Base. Experiments show that RPD-selected training yields
more varied outputs and higher pass@k, with an average +2.80% gain in pass@16
over a strong 1P1S baseline and a +4.99% gain on AIME24, demonstrating that
1PNS further amplifies the effectiveness of TTS. Our code is available at

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between Persuasion Techniques (PTs)
and Discourse Relations (DRs) by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and
prompt engineering. Since no dataset annotated with both PTs and DRs exists, we
took the SemEval 2023 Task 3 dataset labelled with 19 PTs as a starting point
and developed LLM-based classifiers to label each instance of the dataset with
one of the 22 PDTB 3.0 level-2 DRs. In total, four LLMs were evaluated using 10
different prompts, resulting in 40 unique DR classifiers. Ensemble models using
different majority-pooling strategies were used to create 5 silver datasets of
instances labelled with both persuasion techniques and level-2 PDTB senses. The
silver dataset sizes vary from 1,281 instances to 204 instances, depending on
the majority pooling technique used. Statistical analysis of these silver
datasets shows that six discourse relations (namely Cause, Purpose, Contrast,
Cause+Belief, Concession, and Condition) play a crucial role in persuasive
texts, especially in the use of Loaded Language, Exaggeration/Minimisation,
Repetition and to cast Doubt. This insight can contribute to detecting online
propaganda and misinformation, as well as to our general understanding of
effective communication.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced generative
applications in natural language processing (NLP). Recent trends in model
architectures revolve around efficient variants of transformers or
state-space/gated-recurrent models (SSMs, GRMs). However, prevailing
SSM/GRM-based methods often emulate only a single attention head, potentially
limiting their expressiveness. In this work, we propose MossNet, a novel
mixture-of-state-space-experts architecture that emulates a linear multi-head
attention (MHA). MossNet leverages a mixture-of-experts (MoE) implementation
not only in channel-mixing multi-layered perceptron (MLP) blocks but also in
the time-mixing SSM kernels to realize multiple "attention heads." Extensive
experiments on language modeling and downstream evaluations show that MossNet
outperforms both transformer- and SSM-based architectures of similar model size
and data budgets. Larger variants of MossNet, trained on trillions of tokens,
further confirm its scalability and superior performance. In addition,
real-device profiling on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and an Nvidia A100 GPU
demonstrate favorable runtime speed and resource usage compared to similarly
sized baselines. Our results suggest that MossNet is a compelling new direction
for efficient, high-performing recurrent LLM architectures.

Abstract: We introduce Similarity-Distance-Magnitude (SDM) language models (LMs), which
are sequence prediction models fine-tuned to maximize the proportion of
generations in the well-calibrated, high-probability region partitioned by a
final-layer SDM activation layer used for binary classification of
instruction-following. We demonstrate that existing pre-trained decoder-only
Transformer LMs can be readily converted into SDM LMs via supervised
fine-tuning, using the final-layer SDM activation layer during training to
estimate a change-of-base for a supervised next-token loss over a contrastive
input encoding scheme, with additional hard negative examples generated online
during training. This results in reduced abstentions (i.e., improved
statistical efficiency) compared to strong supervised baselines.

Abstract: Current LLM evaluations often rely on a single instruction template,
overlooking models' sensitivity to instruction style-a critical aspect for
real-world deployments. We present RCScore, a multi-dimensional framework
quantifying how instruction formulation affects model responses. By
systematically transforming benchmark problems into multiple instruction
styles, RCScore reveals performance variations undetected by conventional
metrics. Our experiments across ten LLMs on four reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that instruction style can shift accuracy by up to 16.7% points. We
introduce Cross-Response Similarity (CRS), a method applying RCScore metrics to
measure stylistic self-consistency, and establish its strong correlation with
task accuracy, suggesting consistency as a valuable proxy for model
reliability. Additional findings show that deterministic decoding produces more
stylistically stable outputs, and model scale correlates positively with
cross-style consistency. RCScore offers a principled approach to assess
instruction robustness.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their
practical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally
characterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform
and context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,
erasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement
process, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in
uniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token
ordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and
semantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are
frozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This
timestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an
adaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of
refinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies
uniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision
sources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment
control, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves
perplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers
maximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).
Together, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep
allocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving
stable and controllable diffusion text generation.

Abstract: Human feedback can alter language models in unpredictable and undesirable
ways, as practitioners lack a clear understanding of what feedback data
encodes. While prior work studies preferences over certain attributes (e.g.,
length or sycophancy), automatically extracting relevant features without
pre-specifying hypotheses remains challenging. We introduce What's In My Human
Feedback? (WIMHF), a method to explain feedback data using sparse autoencoders.
WIMHF characterizes both (1) the preferences a dataset is capable of measuring
and (2) the preferences that the annotators actually express. Across 7
datasets, WIMHF identifies a small number of human-interpretable features that
account for the majority of the preference prediction signal achieved by
black-box models. These features reveal a wide diversity in what humans prefer,
and the role of dataset-level context: for example, users on Reddit prefer
informality and jokes, while annotators in HH-RLHF and PRISM disprefer them.
WIMHF also surfaces potentially unsafe preferences, such as that LMArena users
tend to vote against refusals, often in favor of toxic content. The learned
features enable effective data curation: re-labeling the harmful examples in
Arena yields large safety gains (+37%) with no cost to general performance.
They also allow fine-grained personalization: on the Community Alignment
dataset, we learn annotator-specific weights over subjective features that
improve preference prediction. WIMHF provides a human-centered analysis method
for practitioners to better understand and use preference data.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a leading approach to
reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Current RAG evaluation
benchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant
chunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only
localized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world
applications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG --
which involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document
collections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, "What are the top 10
most cited papers in 2023?"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering
four core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k
extraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and
baselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks,
with the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these
challenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that
preserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates
LLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates
aggregation modules for precise symbolic computation. On the Qwen2.5-14B model,
GlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 compared to the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1,
validating the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: The ability to accurately interpret implied meanings plays a crucial role in
human communication and language use, and language models are also expected to
possess this capability. This study demonstrates that providing language models
with pragmatic theories as prompts is an effective in-context learning approach
for tasks to understand implied meanings. Specifically, we propose an approach
in which an overview of pragmatic theories, such as Gricean pragmatics and
Relevance Theory, is presented as a prompt to the language model, guiding it
through a step-by-step reasoning process to derive a final interpretation.
Experimental results showed that, compared to the baseline, which prompts
intermediate reasoning without presenting pragmatic theories (0-shot
Chain-of-Thought), our methods enabled language models to achieve up to 9.6\%
higher scores on pragmatic reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we show that even
without explaining the details of pragmatic theories, merely mentioning their
names in the prompt leads to a certain performance improvement (around 1-3%) in
larger models compared to the baseline.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Throughout language history, words are borrowed from one language to another
and gradually become integrated into the recipient's lexicon. Speakers can
often differentiate these loanwords from native vocabulary, particularly in
bilingual communities where a dominant language continuously imposes lexical
items on a minority language. This paper investigates whether pretrained
language models, including large language models, possess similar capabilities
for loanword identification. We evaluate multiple models across 10 languages.
Despite explicit instructions and contextual information, our results show that
models perform poorly in distinguishing loanwords from native ones. These
findings corroborate previous evidence that modern NLP systems exhibit a bias
toward loanwords rather than native equivalents. Our work has implications for
developing NLP tools for minority languages and supporting language
preservation in communities under lexical pressure from dominant languages.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit uneven performance across languages, a
problem that is often exacerbated when the model size is reduced. While
Knowledge distillation (KD) demonstrates promising results in transferring
knowledge from larger to smaller VLMs, applying KD in multilingualism is an
underexplored area. This paper presents a controlled empirical study of KD
behavior across five distillation approaches, isolating their effects on
cross-lingual representation consistency and downstream performance stability
under model compression. We study five distillation formulations across CLIP
and SigLIP2, and evaluate them on in-domain retrieval and out-of-domain visual
QA. We find that some configurations preserve or even improve multilingual
retrieval robustness despite halving model size, but others fail to maintain
cross-task stability, exposing design-sensitive trade-offs that aggregate
accuracy alone does not reveal.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) commonly boost reasoning via
sample-evaluate-ensemble decoders, achieving label free gains without ground
truth. However, prevailing strategies score candidates using only external
outputs such as token probabilities, entropies, or self evaluations, and these
signals can be poorly calibrated after post training. We instead analyze
internal behavior based on neuron activations and uncover three findings: (1)
external signals are low dimensional projections of richer internal dynamics;
(2) correct responses activate substantially fewer unique neurons than
incorrect ones throughout generation; and (3) activations from correct
responses exhibit stronger cross sample agreement, whereas incorrect ones
diverge. Motivated by these observations, we propose Neuron Agreement Decoding
(NAD), an unsupervised best-of-N method that selects candidates using
activation sparsity and cross sample neuron agreement, operating solely on
internal signals and without requiring comparable textual outputs. NAD enables
early correctness prediction within the first 32 generated tokens and supports
aggressive early stopping. Across math and science benchmarks with verifiable
answers, NAD matches majority voting; on open ended coding benchmarks where
majority voting is inapplicable, NAD consistently outperforms Avg@64. By
pruning unpromising trajectories early, NAD reduces token usage by 99% with
minimal loss in generation quality, showing that internal signals provide
reliable, scalable, and efficient guidance for label free ensemble decoding.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that different large language models (LLMs) converge to
similar and accurate input embedding representations for numbers. These
findings conflict with the documented propensity of LLMs to produce erroneous
outputs when dealing with numeric information. In this work, we aim to explain
this conflict by exploring how language models manipulate numbers and quantify
the lower bounds of accuracy of these mechanisms. We find that despite
surfacing errors, different language models learn interchangeable
representations of numbers that are systematic, highly accurate and universal
across their hidden states and the types of input contexts. This allows us to
create universal probes for each LLM and to trace information -- including the
causes of output errors -- to specific layers. Our results lay a fundamental
understanding of how pre-trained LLMs manipulate numbers and outline the
potential of more accurate probing techniques in addressed refinements of LLMs'
architectures.

Abstract: OpenAI's ChatGPT Atlas introduces new capabilities for web interaction,
enabling the model to analyze webpages, process user intents, and execute

information retrieval tasks has been demonstrated, its performance in dynamic,
interactive environments remains less explored. In this study, we conduct an
early evaluation of Atlas's web interaction capabilities using browser-based
games as test scenarios, including Google's T-Rex Runner, Sudoku, Flappy Bird,
and Stein.world. We employ in-game performance scores as quantitative metrics
to assess performance across different task types. Our results show that Atlas
performs strongly in logical reasoning tasks like Sudoku, completing puzzles
significantly faster than human baselines, but struggles substantially in
real-time games requiring precise timing and motor control, often failing to
progress beyond initial obstacles. These findings suggest that while Atlas
demonstrates capable analytical processing, there remain notable limitations in
dynamic web environments requiring real-time interaction. The website of our

Abstract: Language models can be used to provide interactive, personalized student
feedback in educational settings. However, real-world deployment faces three
key challenges: privacy concerns, limited computational resources, and the need
for pedagogically valid responses. These constraints require small, open-source
models that can run locally and reliably ground their outputs in correct
information. We introduce SCRIBE, a framework for multi-hop, tool-augmented
reasoning designed to generate valid responses to student questions about
feedback reports. SCRIBE combines domain-specific tools with a self-reflective
inference pipeline that supports iterative reasoning, tool use, and error
recovery. We distil these capabilities into 3B and 8B models via two-stage LoRA
fine-tuning on synthetic GPT-4o-generated data. Evaluation with a human-aligned
GPT-Judge and a user study with 108 students shows that 8B-SCRIBE models
achieve comparable or superior quality to much larger models in key dimensions
such as relevance and actionability, while being perceived on par with GPT-4o
and Llama-3.3 70B by students. These findings demonstrate the viability of
SCRIBE for low-resource, privacy-sensitive educational applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at general tasks but underperform in
specialized domains like economics and psychology, which require deep,
principled understanding. To address this, we introduce ACER (Automated
Curriculum-Enhanced Regimen) that transforms generalist models into domain
experts without sacrificing their broad capabilities. ACER first synthesizes a
comprehensive, textbook-style curriculum by generating a table of contents for
a subject and then creating question-answer (QA) pairs guided by Bloom's
taxonomy. This ensures systematic topic coverage and progressively increasing
difficulty. The resulting synthetic corpus is used for continual pretraining
with an interleaved curriculum schedule, aligning learning across both content
and cognitive dimensions.
  Experiments with Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B) show significant gains in specialized
MMLU subsets. In challenging domains like microeconomics, where baselines
struggle, ACER boosts accuracy by 5 percentage points. Across all target
domains, we observe a consistent macro-average improvement of 3 percentage
points. Notably, ACER not only prevents catastrophic forgetting but also
facilitates positive cross-domain knowledge transfer, improving performance on
non-target domains by 0.7 points. Beyond MMLU, ACER enhances performance on
knowledge-intensive benchmarks like ARC and GPQA by over 2 absolute points,
while maintaining stable performance on general reasoning tasks. Our results
demonstrate that ACER offers a scalable and effective recipe for closing
critical domain gaps in LLMs.

Abstract: Health-related misinformation is very prevalent and potentially harmful. It
is difficult to identify, especially when claims distort or misinterpret
scientific findings. We investigate the impact of synthetic data generation and
lightweight fine-tuning techniques on the ability of large language models
(LLMs) to recognize fallacious arguments using the MISSCI dataset and
framework. In this work, we propose MisSynth, a pipeline that applies
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to produce synthetic fallacy samples,
which are then used to fine-tune an LLM model. Our results show substantial
accuracy gains with fine-tuned models compared to vanilla baselines. For
instance, the LLaMA 3.1 8B fine-tuned model achieved an over 35% F1-score
absolute improvement on the MISSCI test split over its vanilla baseline. We
demonstrate that introducing synthetic fallacy data to augment limited
annotated resources can significantly enhance zero-shot LLM classification

Abstract: While a multi-agent approach based on large language models (LLMs) represents
a promising strategy to surpass the capabilities of single models, its success
is critically dependent on synergistic team composition. However, forming
optimal teams is a significant challenge, as the inherent opacity of most
models obscures the internal characteristics necessary for effective
collaboration. In this paper, we propose an interaction-centric framework for
automatic team composition that does not require any prior knowledge including
their internal architectures, training data, or task performances. Our method
constructs a "language model graph" that maps relationships between models from
the semantic coherence of pairwise conversations, and then applies community
detection to identify synergistic model clusters. Our experiments with diverse
LLMs demonstrate that the proposed method discovers functionally coherent
groups that reflect their latent specializations. Priming conversations with
specific topics identified synergistic teams which outperform random baselines
on downstream benchmarks and achieve comparable accuracy to that of
manually-curated teams based on known model specializations. Our findings
provide a new basis for the automated design of collaborative multi-agent LLM
teams.

Abstract: With the increasing use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods to
support science workflows, we are interested in the use of discourse-level
information to find supporting evidence for AI generated scientific claims. A
first step towards this objective is to examine the task of inferring discourse
structure in scientific writing.
  In this work, we present a preliminary investigation of pretrained language
model (PLM) and Large Language Model (LLM) approaches for Discourse Relation
Classification (DRC), focusing on scientific publications, an under-studied
genre for this task. We examine how context can help with the DRC task, with
our experiments showing that context, as defined by discourse structure, is
generally helpful. We also present an analysis of which scientific discourse
relation types might benefit most from context.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), various LLM-based
works have been widely applied in educational fields. However, most existing
LLMs and their benchmarks focus primarily on the knowledge dimension, largely
neglecting the evaluation of cultivation capabilities that are essential for
real-world educational scenarios. Additionally, current benchmarks are often
limited to a single subject or question type, lacking sufficient diversity.
This issue is particularly prominent within the Chinese context. To address
this gap, we introduce OmniEduBench, a comprehensive Chinese educational
benchmark. OmniEduBench consists of 24.602K high-quality question-answer pairs.
The data is meticulously divided into two core dimensions: the knowledge
dimension and the cultivation dimension, which contain 18.121K and 6.481K
entries, respectively. Each dimension is further subdivided into 6 fine-grained
categories, covering a total of 61 different subjects (41 in the knowledge and
20 in the cultivation). Furthermore, the dataset features a rich variety of
question formats, including 11 common exam question types, providing a solid
foundation for comprehensively evaluating LLMs' capabilities in education.
Extensive experiments on 11 mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs
reveal a clear performance gap. In the knowledge dimension, only Gemini-2.5 Pro
surpassed 60\% accuracy, while in the cultivation dimension, the
best-performing model, QWQ, still trailed human intelligence by nearly 30\%.
These results highlight the substantial room for improvement and underscore the
challenges of applying LLMs in education.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
language comprehension and generation; however, their widespread adoption is
constrained by substantial bandwidth and computational demands. While pruning
and low-rank approximation have each demonstrated promising performance
individually, their synergy for LLMs remains underexplored. We introduce
\underline{S}ynergistic \underline{S}parse and \underline{L}ow-Rank
\underline{C}ompression (SSLC) methods for LLMs, which leverages the strengths
of both techniques: low-rank approximation compresses the model by retaining
its essential structure with minimal information loss, whereas sparse
optimization eliminates non-essential weights, preserving those crucial for
generalization. Based on theoretical analysis, we first formulate the low-rank
approximation and sparse optimization as a unified problem and solve it by
iterative optimization algorithm. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen2.5 models
(7B-70B) show that SSLC, without any additional training steps, consistently
surpasses standalone methods, achieving state-of-the-arts results. Notably,
SSLC compresses Qwen2.5 by 50\% with no performance drop and achieves at least
1.63$\times$ speedup, offering a practical solution for efficient LLM
deployment.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, with an increasing number
of domain-specific variants tailored for specialised tasks. However, these
models often lack transparency and explainability, can be costly to fine-tune,
require substantial prompt engineering, yield inconsistent results across
domains, and impose significant adverse environmental impact due to their high
computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose the Bayesian
network LLM fusion (BNLF) framework, which integrates predictions from three
LLMs, including FinBERT, RoBERTa, and BERTweet, through a probabilistic
mechanism for sentiment analysis. BNLF performs late fusion by modelling the
sentiment predictions from multiple LLMs as probabilistic nodes within a
Bayesian network. Evaluated across three human-annotated financial corpora with
distinct linguistic and contextual characteristics, BNLF demonstrates
consistent gains of about six percent in accuracy over the baseline LLMs,
underscoring its robustness to dataset variability and the effectiveness of
probabilistic fusion for interpretable sentiment classification.

Abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine if an ensemble of
multiple LLM agents could be used collectively to provide a more reliable
assessment of a pixel-based AI triage tool than a single LLM.
  Methods: 29,766 non-contrast CT head exams from fourteen hospitals were
processed by a commercial intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) AI detection tool.
Radiology reports were analyzed by an ensemble of eight open-source LLM models
and a HIPAA compliant internal version of GPT-4o using a single multi-shot
prompt that assessed for presence of ICH. 1,726 examples were manually
reviewed. Performance characteristics of the eight open-source models and
consensus were compared to GPT-4o. Three ideal consensus LLM ensembles were
tested for rating the performance of the triage tool.
  Results: The cohort consisted of 29,766 head CTs exam-report pairs. The
highest AUC performance was achieved with llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AUC= 0.78).
The average precision was highest for Llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AP=0.75 & 0.76).
Llama3.3:70b had the highest F1 score (0.81) and recall (0.85), greater
precision (0.78), specificity (0.72), and MCC (0.57). Using MCC (95% CI) the
ideal combination of LLMs were: Full-9 Ensemble 0.571 (0.552-0.591), Top-3
Ensemble 0.558 (0.537-0.579), Consensus 0.556 (0.539-0.574), and GPT4o 0.522
(0.500-0.543). No statistically significant differences were observed between
Top-3, Full-9, and Consensus (p > 0.05).
  Conclusion: An ensemble of medium to large sized open-source LLMs provides a
more consistent and reliable method to derive a ground truth retrospective
evaluation of a clinical AI triage tool over a single LLM alone.

Abstract: Diacritics restoration in Hebrew is a fundamental task for ensuring accurate
word pronunciation and disambiguating textual meaning. Despite the language's
high degree of ambiguity when unvocalized, recent machine learning approaches
have significantly advanced performance on this task.
  In this work, we present DIVRIT, a novel system for Hebrew diacritization
that frames the task as a zero-shot classification problem. Our approach
operates at the word level, selecting the most appropriate diacritization
pattern for each undiacritized word from a dynamically generated candidate set,
conditioned on the surrounding textual context. A key innovation of DIVRIT is
its use of a Hebrew Visual Language Model, which processes undiacritized text
as an image, allowing diacritic information to be embedded directly within the
input's vector representation.
  Through a comprehensive evaluation across various configurations, we
demonstrate that the system effectively performs diacritization without relying
on complex, explicit linguistic analysis. Notably, in an ``oracle'' setting
where the correct diacritized form is guaranteed to be among the provided
candidates, DIVRIT achieves a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, strategic
architectural enhancements and optimized training methodologies yield
significant improvements in the system's overall generalization capabilities.
These findings highlight the promising potential of visual representations for
accurate and automated Hebrew diacritization.

Abstract: This paper investigates the structure of linear operators introduced in
Hernandez et al. [2023] that decode specific relational facts in transformer
language models. We extend their single-relation findings to a collection of
relations and systematically chart their organization. We show that such
collections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3
tensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this
surprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we
apply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our
results reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but
extract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital
city and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This
property-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and
highlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically
close. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer
language models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for enhancing agentic deep search. However, its application is often hindered
by low \textbf{Reward Density} in deep search scenarios, where agents expend
significant exploratory costs for infrequent and often null final rewards. In
this paper, we formalize this challenge as the \textbf{Reward Density
Optimization} problem, which aims to improve the reward obtained per unit of
exploration cost. This paper introduce \textbf{InfoFlow}, a systematic
framework that tackles this problem from three aspects. 1) \textbf{Subproblem
decomposition}: breaking down long-range tasks to assign process rewards,
thereby providing denser learning signals. 2) \textbf{Failure-guided hints}:
injecting corrective guidance into stalled trajectories to increase the
probability of successful outcomes. 3) \textbf{Dual-agent refinement}:
employing a dual-agent architecture to offload the cognitive burden of deep
exploration. A refiner agent synthesizes the search history, which effectively
compresses the researcher's perceived trajectory, thereby reducing exploration
cost and increasing the overall reward density. We evaluate InfoFlow on
multiple agentic search benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms strong
baselines, enabling lightweight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to
advanced proprietary LLMs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant inference latency challenges
stemming from their autoregressive design and large size. To address this,
speculative decoding emerges as a solution, enabling the simultaneous
generation and validation of multiple tokens. While recent approaches like
EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3 improve speculative decoding using dynamic tree structures,
they often neglect the impact of crucial system variables such as GPU devices
and batch sizes.
  Therefore, we introduce a new dynamic tree decoding approach called CAST that
takes into account inference costs, including factors such as GPU
configurations and batch sizes, to dynamically refine the tree structure.
Through comprehensive experimentation across six diverse tasks and utilizing
six distinct LLMs, our methodology demonstrates remarkable results, achieving
speeds up to 5.2 times faster than conventional decoding methods. Moreover, it
generally outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques from 5% to 20%.

Abstract: Multi-page visual documents such as manuals, brochures, presentations, and
posters convey key information through layout, colors, icons, and cross-slide
references. While large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities in document
understanding, current systems struggle with complex, multi-page visual
documents, particularly in fine-grained reasoning over elements and pages. We
introduce SlideAgent, a versatile agentic framework for understanding
multi-modal, multi-page, and multi-layout documents, especially slide decks.
SlideAgent employs specialized agents and decomposes reasoning into three
specialized levels-global, page, and element-to construct a structured,
query-agnostic representation that captures both overarching themes and
detailed visual or textual cues. During inference, SlideAgent selectively
activates specialized agents for multi-level reasoning and integrates their
outputs into coherent, context-aware answers. Extensive experiments show that
SlideAgent achieves significant improvement over both proprietary (+7.9
overall) and open-source models (+9.8 overall).

Abstract: Recent large language model (LLM) research has undergone an architectural
shift from encoder-decoder modeling to nowadays the dominant decoder-only
modeling. This rapid transition, however, comes without a rigorous comparative
analysis especially \textit{from the scaling perspective}, raising concerns
that the potential of encoder-decoder models may have been overlooked. To fill
this gap, we revisit encoder-decoder LLM (RedLLM), enhancing it with recent
recipes from decoder-only LLM (DecLLM). We conduct a comprehensive comparison
between RedLLM, pretrained with prefix language modeling (LM), and DecLLM,
pretrained with causal LM, at different model scales, ranging from $\sim$150M
to $\sim$8B. Using RedPajama V1 (1.6T tokens) for pretraining and FLAN for
instruction tuning, our experiments show that RedLLM produces compelling
scaling properties and surprisingly strong performance. While DecLLM is overall
more compute-optimal during pretraining, RedLLM demonstrates comparable scaling
and context length extrapolation capabilities. After instruction tuning, RedLLM
achieves comparable and even better results on various downstream tasks while
enjoying substantially better inference efficiency. We hope our findings could
inspire more efforts on re-examining RedLLM, unlocking its potential for
developing powerful and efficient LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities
across multiple domains by leveraging massive pre-training and curated
fine-tuning data. However, in data-sensitive fields such as healthcare, the
lack of high-quality, domain-specific training corpus hinders LLMs' adaptation
for specialized applications. Meanwhile, domain experts have distilled domain
wisdom into ontology rules, which formalize relationships among concepts and
ensure the integrity of knowledge management repositories. Viewing LLMs as
implicit repositories of human knowledge, we propose Evontree, a novel
framework that leverages a small set of high-quality ontology rules to
systematically extract, validate, and enhance domain knowledge within LLMs,
without requiring extensive external datasets. Specifically, Evontree extracts
domain ontology from raw models, detects inconsistencies using two core
ontology rules, and reinforces the refined knowledge via self-distilled
fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on medical QA benchmarks with
Llama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 demonstrate consistent outperformance over both
unmodified models and leading supervised baselines, achieving up to a 3.7%
improvement in accuracy. These results confirm the effectiveness, efficiency,
and robustness of our approach for low-resource domain adaptation of LLMs.

Abstract: We introduce Kimi Linear, a hybrid linear attention architecture that, for
the first time, outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across
various scenarios -- including short-context, long-context, and reinforcement
learning (RL) scaling regimes. At its core lies Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), an
expressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a
finer-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limited
finite-state RNN memory. Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware
efficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)
transition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the
general DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical
delta rule.
  We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total
parameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention
(MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear
outperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while
reducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding
throughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be
a drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior
performance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output
lengths.
  To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM
implementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model
checkpoints.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The "end-to-end" label for LLMs is a misnomer. In practice, they depend on a
non-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of
hyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, a
novel architecture that enables truly "end-to-end" generation by learning to
control its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer with
lightweight heads that, at each step, dynamically predict context-specific
temperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits. This approach
transforms decoding into a parametric, token-level process, allowing the model
to self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass.
  Through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, we demonstrate that
AutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but
also achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline derived from
"hacking the test set"-a practical upper bound for any static method.
Crucially, we uncover an emergent capability for instruction-based decoding
control: the model learns to interpret natural language commands (e.g.,
"generate with low randomness") and adjusts its predicted temperature and top-p
on a token-by-token basis, opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive
LLM decoding.

Abstract: As LLMs occupy an increasingly important role in society, they are more and
more confronted with questions that require them not only to draw on their
general knowledge but also to align with certain human value systems.
Therefore, studying the alignment of LLMs with human values has become a
crucial field of inquiry. Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating the
alignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by which
models learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and at
which stage value alignment arises during the course of a model's
post-training. Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-training
algorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts
during training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different
sizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization
datasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a
model's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these
values. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables
controlled manipulation of values, we find that different preference
optimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when
preference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into
how values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation,
as well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization
to improve model alignment to human values.

Abstract: We present AMO-Bench, an Advanced Mathematical reasoning benchmark with
Olympiad level or even higher difficulty, comprising 50 human-crafted problems.
Existing benchmarks have widely leveraged high school math competitions for
evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, many existing math competitions are becoming less effective for
assessing top-tier LLMs due to performance saturation (e.g., AIME24/25). To
address this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50
problems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original
problems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization.
Moreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a
proof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation. Experimental
results across 26 LLMs on AMO-Bench show that even the best-performing model
achieves only 52.4% accuracy on AMO-Bench, with most LLMs scoring below 40%.
Beyond these poor performances, our further analysis reveals a promising
scaling trend with increasing test-time compute on AMO-Bench. These results
highlight the significant room for improving the mathematical reasoning in
current LLMs. We release AMO-Bench to facilitate further research into
advancing the reasoning abilities of language models.

Abstract: As coding agents are increasingly deployed in large codebases, the need to
automatically design challenging, codebase-level evaluation is central. We
propose Gistify, a task where a coding LLM must create a single, minimal,
self-contained file that can reproduce a specific functionality of a codebase.
The coding LLM is given full access to a codebase along with a specific
entrypoint (e.g., a python command), and the generated file must replicate the
output of the same command ran under the full codebase, while containing only
the essential components necessary to execute the provided command. Success on
Gistify requires both structural understanding of the codebase, accurate
modeling of its execution flow as well as the ability to produce potentially
large code patches. Our findings show that current state-of-the-art models
struggle to reliably solve Gistify tasks, especially ones with long executions
traces.

Benchmark for Reproducible Research with HIdden Tests (ORBIT), a unified
benchmark for consistent and realistic evaluation of recommendation models.
ORBIT offers a standardized evaluation framework of public datasets with
reproducible splits and transparent settings for its public leaderboard.
Additionally, ORBIT introduces a new webpage recommendation task, ClueWeb-Reco,
featuring web browsing sequences from 87 million public, high-quality webpages.
ClueWeb-Reco is a synthetic dataset derived from real, user-consented, and
privacy-guaranteed browsing data. It aligns with modern recommendation
scenarios and is reserved as the hidden test part of our leaderboard to
challenge recommendation models' generalization ability. ORBIT measures 12
representative recommendation models on its public benchmark and introduces a
prompted LLM baseline on the ClueWeb-Reco hidden test. Our benchmark results
reflect general improvements of recommender systems on the public datasets,
with variable individual performances. The results on the hidden test reveal
the limitations of existing approaches in large-scale webpage recommendation
and highlight the potential for improvements with LLM integrations. ORBIT
benchmark, leaderboard, and codebase are available at

Abstract: In recommendation systems, scaling up feature-interaction modules (e.g.,
Wukong, RankMixer) or user-behavior sequence modules (e.g., LONGER) has
achieved notable success. However, these efforts typically proceed on separate
tracks, which not only hinders bidirectional information exchange but also
prevents unified optimization and scaling. In this paper, we propose OneTrans,
a unified Transformer backbone that simultaneously performs user-behavior
sequence modeling and feature interaction. OneTrans employs a unified tokenizer
to convert both sequential and non-sequential attributes into a single token
sequence. The stacked OneTrans blocks share parameters across similar
sequential tokens while assigning token-specific parameters to non-sequential
tokens. Through causal attention and cross-request KV caching, OneTrans enables
precomputation and caching of intermediate representations, significantly
reducing computational costs during both training and inference. Experimental
results on industrial-scale datasets demonstrate that OneTrans scales
efficiently with increasing parameters, consistently outperforms strong
baselines, and yields a 5.68% lift in per-user GMV in online A/B tests.

Abstract: Legal case retrieval (LCR) is a cornerstone of real-world legal decision
making, as it enables practitioners to identify precedents for a given query
case. Existing approaches mainly rely on traditional lexical models and
pretrained language models to encode the texts of legal cases. Yet there are
rich information in the relations among different legal entities as well as the
crucial reasoning process that uncovers how legal facts and legal issues can
lead to judicial decisions. Such relational reasoning process reflects the
distinctive characteristics of each case that can distinguish one from another,
mirroring the real-world judicial process. Naturally, incorporating such
information into the precise case embedding could further enhance the accuracy
of case retrieval. In this paper, a novel ReaKase-8B framework is proposed to
leverage extracted legal facts, legal issues, legal relation triplets and legal
reasoning for effective legal case retrieval. ReaKase-8B designs an in-context
legal case representation learning paradigm with a fine-tuned large language
model. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets from COLIEE 2022 and
COLIEE 2023 demonstrate that our knowledge and reasoning augmented embeddings
substantially improve retrieval performance over baseline models, highlighting
the potential of integrating legal reasoning into legal case retrieval systems.

Abstract: Automatic structure elucidation is essential for self-driving laboratories as
it enables the system to achieve truly autonomous. This capability closes the
experimental feedback loop, ensuring that machine learning models receive
reliable structure information for real-time decision-making and optimization.
Herein, we present DiSE, an end-to-end diffusion-based generative model that
integrates multiple spectroscopic modalities, including MS, 13C and 1H chemical
shifts, HSQC, and COSY, to achieve automated yet accurate structure elucidation
of organic compounds. By learning inherent correlations among spectra through
data-driven approaches, DiSE achieves superior accuracy, strong generalization
across chemically diverse datasets, and robustness to experimental data despite
being trained on calculated spectra. DiSE thus represents a significant advance
toward fully automated structure elucidation, with broad potential in natural
product research, drug discovery, and self-driving laboratories.

Abstract: Sequential recommendation models must navigate sparse interaction data
popularity bias and conflicting objectives like accuracy versus diversity While
recent contrastive selfsupervised learning SSL methods offer improved accuracy
they come with tradeoffs large batch requirements reliance on handcrafted
augmentations and negative sampling that can reinforce popularity bias In this
paper we introduce BT-SR a novel noncontrastive SSL framework that integrates
the Barlow Twins redundancyreduction principle into a Transformerbased nextitem
recommender BTSR learns embeddings that align users with similar shortterm
behaviors while preserving longterm distinctionswithout requiring negative
sampling or artificial perturbations This structuresensitive alignment allows
BT-SR to more effectively recognize emerging user intent and mitigate the
influence of noisy historical context Our experiments on five public benchmarks
demonstrate that BTSR consistently improves nextitem prediction accuracy and
significantly enhances longtail item coverage and recommendation calibration
Crucially we show that a single hyperparameter can control the
accuracydiversity tradeoff enabling practitioners to adapt recommendations to
specific application needs

Abstract: Recommender systems often struggle with data sparsity and cold-start
scenarios, limiting their ability to provide accurate suggestions for new or
infrequent users. This paper presents a Graph Attention Network (GAT) based
Collaborative Filtering (CF) framework enhanced with Large Language Model (LLM)
driven context aware embeddings. Specifically, we generate concise textual user
profiles and unify item metadata (titles, genres, overviews) into rich textual
embeddings, injecting these as initial node features in a bipartite user item
graph. To further optimize ranking performance, we introduce a hybrid loss
function that combines Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) with a cosine
similarity term and robust negative sampling, ensuring explicit negative
feedback is distinguished from unobserved data. Experiments on the MovieLens
100k and 1M datasets show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art
baselines in Precision, NDCG, and MAP while demonstrating robustness for users
with limited interaction history. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of
LLM-augmented embeddings and the cosine similarity term in capturing nuanced
semantic relationships. Our approach effectively mitigates sparsity and
cold-start limitations by integrating LLM-derived contextual understanding into
graph-based architectures. Future directions include balancing recommendation
accuracy with coverage and diversity, and introducing fairness-aware
constraints and interpretability features to enhance system performance
further.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) seeks to improve user
preference modeling by transferring knowledge from multiple domains. Despite
the progress made in CDSR, most existing methods rely on overlapping users or
items to establish cross-domain correlations-a requirement that rarely holds in
real-world settings. The advent of large language models (LLM) and
model-merging techniques appears to overcome this limitation by unifying
multi-domain data without explicit overlaps. Yet, our empirical study shows
that naively training an LLM on combined domains-or simply merging several
domain-specific LLMs-often degrades performance relative to a model trained
solely on the target domain. To address these challenges, we first
experimentally investigate the cause of suboptimal performance in LLM-based
cross-domain recommendation and model merging. Building on these insights, we
introduce WeaveRec, which cross-trains multiple LoRA modules with source and
target domain data in a weaving fashion, and fuses them via model merging.
WeaveRec can be extended to multi-source domain scenarios and notably does not
introduce additional inference-time cost in terms of latency or memory.
Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee that WeaveRec can reduce the
upper bound of the expected error in the target domain. Extensive experiments
on single-source, multi-source, and cross-platform cross-domain recommendation
scenarios validate that WeaveRec effectively mitigates performance degradation
and consistently outperforms baseline approaches in real-world recommendation
tasks.

Abstract: Systematic reviews and mapping studies are critical for synthesizing
research, identifying gaps, and guiding future work, but they are often
labor-intensive and time-consuming. Existing tools provide partial support for
specific steps, leaving much of the process manual and error-prone. We present
ProfOlaf, a semi-automated tool designed to streamline systematic reviews while
maintaining methodological rigor. ProfOlaf supports iterative snowballing for
article collection with human-in-the-loop filtering and uses large language
models to assist in analyzing articles, extracting key topics, and answering
queries about the content of papers. By combining automation with guided manual
effort, ProfOlaf enhances the efficiency, quality, and reproducibility of
systematic reviews across research fields. A video describing and demonstrating
ProfOlaf is available at: https://youtu.be/4noUXfcmxsE
