The Knowledge\nTracing (KT) task aims to predict how students will respond to educational\nquestions in learning environments, based on their prior interactions. Existing\nKT models typically use response correctness along with metadata like skill\ntags and timestamps, often overlooking the question text, which is an important\nsource of pedagogical insight. This omission poses a lost opportunity while\nlimiting predictive performance. We propose Next Token Knowledge Tracing\n(NTKT), a novel approach that reframes KT as a next-token prediction task using\npretrained Large Language Models (LLMs). NTKT represents both student histories\nand question content as sequences of text, allowing LLMs to learn patterns in\nboth behaviour and language. Our series of experiments significantly improves\nperformance over state-of-the-art neural KT models and generalises much better\nto cold-start questions and users. These findings highlight the importance of\nquestion content in KT and demonstrate the benefits of leveraging pretrained\nrepresentations of LLMs to model student learning more effectively."}

We introduce Confidence-Guided\nEarly Stopping (CGES), a Bayesian framework that forms posteriors over\ncandidate answers using scalar confidence signals derived from token\nprobabilities or reward models. CGES adaptively halts sampling once the\nposterior mass of a candidate exceeds a threshold.

This misalignment, which we term the Alignment-Reality Gap, poses a\ngrowing challenge for reliable long-term use. Existing remedies are inadequate:\nlarge-scale re-annotation is economically prohibitive, and standard unlearning\nmethods act as blunt instruments that erode utility rather than enable precise\npolicy updates. We introduce TRACE (Triage and Re-align by Alignment Conflict\nEvaluation), a framework for principled unlearning that reconceives\nre-alignment as a programmatic policy application problem. TRACE\nprogrammatically triages existing preference data against a new policy,\nidentifies high-impact conflicts via a alignment impact score, and applies a\nhybrid optimization that cleanly inverts, discards, or preserves preferences\nwhile safeguarding model performance. Empirical results show that TRACE\nachieves robust re-alignment across diverse model families (Qwen2.5-7B,\nGemma-2-9B, Llama-3.1-8B).

Our work\naddresses this gap by designing a controlled dataset Biography-Reasoning, and\nconducting a fine-grained analysis across multiple knowledge types and two task\ntypes, including knowledge question answering (QA) and knowledge reasoning\ntasks. We find that when fine-tuned on a dataset in which a specific knowledge\ntype consists entirely of new knowledge, LLMs exhibit significantly increased\nhallucination tendencies. This suggests that the high unfamiliarity of a\nparticular knowledge type, rather than the overall proportion of new knowledge,\nis a stronger driver of hallucinations, and these tendencies can even affect\nother knowledge types in QA tasks. To mitigate such factual hallucinations, we\npropose KnownPatch, which patches a small number of known knowledge samples in\nthe later stages of training, effectively alleviating new-knowledge-induced\nhallucinations. Through attention analysis, we find that learning new knowledge\nreduces the model's attention to key entities in the question, thus causing\nexcessive focus on the surrounding context, which may increase the risk of\nhallucination. Moreover, the attention pattern can propagate to similar\ncontexts, facilitating the spread of hallucinations to textually similar\nquestions. Our method effectively mitigates the disruption of new knowledge\nlearning to the model's attention on key entities, accompanied by improved\nperformance."}

However, their enormous size limits storage and processing\ncapabilities to a few well-resourced stakeholders. As a result, most\napplications rely on pre-trained LLMs, fine-tuned for specific tasks. However,\neven storing the fine-tuned versions of these models remains a significant\nchallenge due to the wide range of tasks they address. Recently, studies show\nthat fine-tuning these models primarily affects a small fraction of parameters,\nhighlighting the need for more efficient storage of fine-tuned models. This\npaper focuses on efficient storage of parameter updates in pre-trained models\nafter fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we leverage the observation that\nfine-tuning updates are both low-rank and sparse, which can be utilized for\nstorage efficiency. However, using only low-rank approximation or\nsparsification may discard critical singular components that enhance model\nexpressivity. We first observe that given the same memory budget, sparsified\nlow-rank approximations with larger ranks outperform standard low-rank\napproximations with smaller ranks. Building on this, we propose our method,\noptimal singular damage, that selectively sparsifies low-rank approximated\nupdates by leveraging the interleaved importance of singular vectors, ensuring\nthat the most impactful components are retained. We demonstrate through\nextensive experiments that our proposed methods lead to significant storage\nefficiency and superior accuracy within the same memory budget compared to\nemploying the low-rank approximation or sparsification individually."}

In\nthis work, we introduce a centralized multi-LLM framework, where a controller\nLLM selectively coordinates a pool of expert models in a cost-efficient and\ncost-controllable manner.
