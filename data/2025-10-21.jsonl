The\ncore of our approach lies in decoupling tasks into two distinct phases: Offline\nknowledge ingestion and online task processing.

Most existing methods rely on static, semantic retrieval\napproaches for tool or agent discovery. However, effective reuse and\ncomposition of existing components remain challenging due to incomplete\ncapability descriptions and the limitations of retrieval methods. Component\nselection suffers because the decisions are not based on capability, cost, and\nreal-time utility. To address these challenges, we introduce a structured,\nautomated framework for agentic system composition that is inspired by the\nknapsack problem. Our framework enables a composer agent to systematically\nidentify, select, and assemble an optimal set of agentic components by jointly\nconsidering performance, budget constraints, and compatibility. By dynamically\ntesting candidate components and modeling their utility in real-time, our\napproach streamlines the assembly of agentic systems and facilitates scalable\nreuse of resources. Empirical evaluation with Claude 3.5 Sonnet across five\nbenchmarking datasets shows that our online-knapsack-based composer\nconsistently lies on the Pareto frontier, achieving higher success rates at\nsignificantly lower component costs compared to our baselines. In the\nsingle-agent setup, the online knapsack composer shows a success rate\nimprovement of up to 31.6% in comparison to the retrieval baselines. In\nmulti-agent systems, the online knapsack composer increases success rate from\n37% to 87% when agents are selected from an agent inventory of 100+ agents. The\nsubstantial performance gap confirms the robust adaptability of our method\nacross diverse domains and budget constraints."}

Despite\nhaving sufficient numerical knowledge to answer correctly, LLMs frequently make\npredictions that contradict this knowledge. We identify three heuristic biases\nthat strongly influence model predictions: entity popularity, mention order,\nand semantic co-occurrence. For smaller models, a simple logistic regression\nusing only these surface cues predicts model choices more accurately than the\nmodel's own numerical predictions, suggesting heuristics largely override\nprincipled reasoning. Crucially, we find that larger models (32B parameters)\nselectively rely on numerical knowledge when it is more reliable, while smaller\nmodels (7--8B parameters) show no such discrimination, which explains why\nlarger models outperform smaller ones even when the smaller models possess more\naccurate knowledge. Chain-of-thought prompting steers all models towards using\nthe numerical features across all model sizes."}

Irony provides an ideal paradigm because it\nrequires distinguishing intentional contradictions from unintended errors\nthrough effortful semantic reanalysis. We compared behavioral and neural\nresponses to ironic statements from AI versus human sources using established\nERP components: P200 reflecting early incongruity detection and P600 indexing\ncognitive efforts in reinterpreting incongruity as deliberate irony. Results\ndemonstrate that people do not fully adopt the intentional stance toward\nAI-generated irony. Behaviorally, participants attributed incongruity to\ndeliberate communication for both sources, though significantly less for AI\nthan human, showing greater tendency to interpret AI incongruities as\ncomputational errors. Neural data revealed attenuated P200 and P600 effects for\nAI-generated irony, suggesting reduced effortful detection and reanalysis\nconsistent with diminished attribution of communicative intent. Notably, people\nwho perceived AI as more sincere showed larger P200 and P600 effects for\nAI-generated irony, suggesting that intentional stance adoption is calibrated\nby specific mental models of artificial agents. These findings reveal that\nsource attribution shapes neural processing of social-communicative phenomena.\nDespite current LLMs' linguistic sophistication, achieving genuine social\nagency requires more than linguistic competence, it necessitates a shift in how\nhumans perceive and attribute intentionality to artificial agents."}

This significantly limits LLMs' reliability in knowledge-intensive\napplications. To address this, we introduce a novel Attention-Shifting (AS)\nframework for selective unlearning. AS is driven by two design objectives: (1)\ncontext-preserving suppression that attenuates attention to fact-bearing tokens\nwithout disrupting LLMs' linguistic structure; and (2) hallucination-resistant\nresponse shaping that discourages fabricated completions when queried about\nunlearning content. AS realizes these objectives through two attention-level\ninterventions, which are importance-aware suppression applied to the unlearning\nset to reduce reliance on memorized knowledge and attention-guided retention\nenhancement that reinforces attention toward semantically essential tokens in\nthe retained dataset to mitigate unintended degradation. These two components\nare jointly optimized via a dual-loss objective, which forms a soft boundary\nthat localizes unlearning while preserving unrelated knowledge under\nrepresentation superposition.

While zero-shot and instruction-tuned approaches have\nmade progress, they often fail to generalize to domain-specific entities and do\nnot effectively utilize limited available data. We present a lightweight\nfew-shot NER framework that addresses these challenges through two key\ninnovations: (1) a new instruction tuning template with a simplified output\nformat that combines principles from prior IT approaches to leverage the large\ncontext window of recent state-of-the-art LLMs; (2) introducing a strategic\ndata augmentation technique that preserves entity information while\nparaphrasing the surrounding context, thereby expanding our training data\nwithout compromising semantic relationships. Experiments on benchmark datasets\nshow that our method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models\non few-shot and zero-shot tasks, with our few-shot approach attaining an\naverage F1 score of 80.1 on the CrossNER datasets. Models trained with our\nparaphrasing approach show consistent improvements in F1 scores of up to 17\npoints over baseline versions, offering a promising solution for groups with\nlimited NER training data and compute power."}

Existing\nmitigation approaches often degrade performance on open-ended generation and\ndownstream tasks, limiting their practical utility. We propose an online\nreinforcement learning method using a novel binary retrieval-augmented reward\n(RAR) to address this tradeoff. Unlike continuous reward schemes, our approach\nassigns a reward of one only when the model's output is entirely factually\ncorrect, and zero otherwise. We evaluate our method on Qwen3 reasoning models\nacross diverse tasks. For open-ended generation, binary RAR achieves a 39.3%\nreduction in hallucination rates, substantially outperforming both supervised\ntraining and continuous-reward RL baselines. In short-form question answering,\nthe model learns calibrated abstention, strategically outputting \"I don't know\"\nwhen faced with insufficient parametric knowledge. This yields 44.4% and 21.7%\nfewer incorrect answers on PopQA and GPQA, respectively. Crucially, these\nfactuality gains come without performance degradation on instruction following,\nmath, or code, whereas continuous-reward RL, despite improving factuality,\ninduces quality regressions."}
