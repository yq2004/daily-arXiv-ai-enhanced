Despite significant progress in the development\nof methods and models that refrain from using stereotypical information in\ntheir decision-making, recent work has shown that approaches used for bias\nalignment are brittle. In this work, we introduce a novel and general\naugmentation framework that involves three plug-and-play steps and is\napplicable to a number of fairness evaluation benchmarks. Through application\nof augmentation to a fairness evaluation dataset (Bias Benchmark for Question\nAnswering (BBQ)), we find that Large Language Models (LLMs), including\nstate-of-the-art open and closed weight models, are susceptible to\nperturbations to their inputs, showcasing a higher likelihood to behave\nstereotypically. Furthermore, we find that such models are more likely to have\nbiased behavior in cases where the target demographic belongs to a community\nless studied by the literature, underlining the need to expand the fairness and\nsafety research to include more diverse communities.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This insight is based on prior theoretical and empirical\nwork showing that the curvature for memorized training points is much sharper\nthan non memorized, meaning ordering weight components from high to low\ncurvature can reveal a distinction without explicit labels. This motivates a\nweight editing procedure that suppresses far more recitation of untargeted\nmemorized data more effectively than a recent unlearning method\n(BalancedSubnet), while maintaining lower perplexity. Since the basis of\ncurvature has a natural interpretation for shared structure in model weights,\nwe analyze the editing procedure extensively on its effect on downstream tasks\nin LMs, and find that fact retrieval and arithmetic are specifically and\nconsistently negatively affected, even though open book fact retrieval and\ngeneral logical reasoning is conserved. We posit these tasks rely heavily on\nspecialized directions in weight space rather than general purpose mechanisms,\nregardless of whether those individual datapoints are memorized. We support\nthis by showing a correspondence between task data's activation strength with\nlow curvature components that we edit out, and the drop in task performance\nafter the edit. Our work enhances the understanding of memorization in neural\nnetworks with practical applications towards removing it, and provides evidence\nfor idiosyncratic, narrowly-used structures involved in solving tasks like math\nand fact retrieval.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However,\nwhen a word appears in a text, this ambiguity is generally much reduced.\nDisambiguating POS involves using context to reduce the number of POS\nassociated with words, and is one of the main challenges of lexical tagging.\nThe problem of labeling words by POS frequently arises in natural language\nprocessing, for example for spelling correction, grammar or style checking,\nexpression recognition, text-to-speech conversion, text corpus analysis, etc.\nLexical tagging systems are thus useful as an initial component of many natural\nlanguage processing systems. A number of recent lexical tagging systems produce\nmultiple solutions when the text is lexically ambiguous or the uniquely correct\nsolution cannot be found. These contributions aim to guarantee a zero silence\nrate: the correct tag(s) for a word must never be discarded. This objective is\nunrealistic for systems that tag each word uniquely. This article concerns a\nlexical disambiguation method adapted to the objective of a zero silence rate\nand implemented in Silberztein's INTEX system (1993). We present here a formal\ndescription of this method. We show that to verify a local disambiguation\ngrammar in this framework, it is not sufficient to consider the transducer\npaths separately: one needs to verify their interactions. Similarly, if a\ncombination of multiple transducers is used, the result cannot be predicted by\nconsidering them in isolation. Furthermore, when examining the initial labeling\nof a text as produced by INTEX, ideas for disambiguation rules come\nspontaneously, but grammatical intuitions may turn out to be inaccurate, often\ndue to an unforeseen construction or ambiguity. If a zero silence rate is\ntargeted, local grammars must be carefully tested.

A common\npractice, Prompt-Based Role Playing (PBRP),\n  instructs models to adopt different clinical roles (e.g., medical students,\nresidents, attending physicians) to simulate varied\n  professional behaviors. However, the impact of such role prompts on model\nreasoning capabilities remains unclear. This\n  study introduces the RP-Neuron-Activated Evaluation Framework(RPNA) to\nevaluate whether role prompts induce distinct,\n  role-specific cognitive processes in LLMs or merely modify linguistic style.\nWe test this framework on three medical QA\n  datasets, employing neuron ablation and representation analysis techniques to\nassess changes in reasoning pathways. Our\n  results demonstrate that role prompts do not significantly enhance the\nmedical reasoning abilities of LLMs. Instead, they\n  primarily affect surface-level linguistic features, with no evidence of\ndistinct reasoning pathways or cognitive differentiation\n  across clinical roles. Despite superficial stylistic changes, the core\ndecision-making mechanisms of LLMs remain uniform\n  across roles, indicating that current PBRP methods fail to replicate the\ncognitive complexity found in real-world medical\n  practice. This highlights the limitations of role-playing in medical AI and\nemphasizes the need for models that simulate genuine\n  cognitive processes rather than linguistic imitation.We have released the\nrelated code in the following repository:https:\n  //github.com/IAAR-Shanghai/RolePlay_LLMDoctor", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
