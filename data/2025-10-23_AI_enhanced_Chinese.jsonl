As a result, information that\nlarge language models (LLMs) and AI agents process is inherently framed by\nhumans' intentions and incentives. People are adept at navigating such nuanced\ninformation: we routinely identify benevolent or self-serving motives in order\nto decide what statements to trust. For LLMs to be effective in the real world,\nthey too must critically evaluate content by factoring in the motivations of\nthe source -- for instance, weighing the credibility of claims made in a sales\npitch. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study of whether LLMs have\nthis capacity for motivational vigilance. We first employ controlled\nexperiments from cognitive science to verify that LLMs' behavior is consistent\nwith rational models of learning from motivated testimony, and find they\nsuccessfully discount information from biased sources in a human-like manner.\nWe then extend our evaluation to sponsored online adverts, a more naturalistic\nreflection of LLM agents' information ecosystems. In these settings, we find\nthat LLMs' inferences do not track the rational models' predictions nearly as\nclosely -- partly due to additional information that distracts them from\nvigilance-relevant considerations. However, a simple steering intervention that\nboosts the salience of intentions and incentives substantially increases the\ncorrespondence between LLMs and the rational model.
