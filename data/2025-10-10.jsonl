Existing\napproaches typically follow the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) paradigm:\nfirst retrieving subgraphs relevant to the query and then generating answers\nconditioned on the retrieved subgraphs. However, such two-phase pipelines often\nstruggle to faithfully incorporate graph structure, since the generation\nprocess is ultimately constrained by the quality and completeness of the\nretrieved subgraph. Although many advanced retrievers have been proposed\nrecently to mitigate this issue, they are usually tailored to the training\ngraphs and generalize poorly to unseen graphs, which limits their practical\napplicability. In this work, we propose Reasoning by Exploration (RoE), a novel\napproach that unifies retrieval and generation by framing reasoning over graphs\nas a process of graph exploration. At each step, the LLM selects candidate\nnodes and edges to explore, gradually constructing reasoning paths and\ngenerating answers along the way. To enable effective exploration, RoE is\ntrained in two stages: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on gold reasoning paths,\nfollowed by reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance exploration effectiveness\nand generalization. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that RoE\nachieves substantial overall improvements over baselines, while also\ngeneralizing effectively to unseen graphs."}

To\naddress this, we propose the Information Seeking in Modern Information\nEnvironments (ISMIE) framework as a fundamental step. ISMIE conceptualizes the\ninformation seeking process (ISP) via three key concepts: Components (e.g.,\nInformation Seeker), Intervening Variables (e.g., Interactive Variables), and\nActivities (e.g., Acquiring). Using ISMIE's concepts and employing a case study\nbased on a common scenario - misinformation dissemination - we analyze six\nexisting IS and information retrieval (IR) models to illustrate their\nlimitations and the necessity of ISMIE.

From this translated corpus, a lexicon is constructed using\nthe phonological model and the set of morphemes (stems and affixes) extracted\nfrom the 'translated' sentences. The system is then instructed to provide an\northography for the language, using an existing script such as Latin or\nCyrillic.

Existing hate\nspeech detection models, which predominantly rely on surface-level linguistic\ncues, fail to generalize effectively across diverse stylistic variations.\nMoreover, hate speech spread on different platforms often targets distinct\ngroups and adopts unique styles, potentially inducing spurious correlations\nbetween them and labels, further challenging current detection approaches.\nMotivated by these observations, we hypothesize that the generation of hate\nspeech can be modeled as a causal graph involving key factors: contextual\nenvironment, creator motivation, target, and style. Guided by this graph, we\npropose CADET, a causal representation learning framework that disentangles\nhate speech into interpretable latent factors and then controls confounders,\nthereby isolating genuine hate intent from superficial linguistic cues.\nFurthermore, CADET allows counterfactual reasoning by intervening on style\nwithin the latent space, naturally guiding the model to robustly identify hate\nspeech in varying forms. CADET demonstrates superior performance in\ncomprehensive experiments, highlighting the potential of causal priors in\nadvancing generalizable hate speech detection."}

While prior work has\nexplored solutions to mitigate overthinking, a fundamental gap remains in our\nunderstanding of its underlying causes. Most existing analyses are limited to\nsuperficial, profiling-based observations, failing to delve into LLMs' inner\nworkings. This study introduces a systematic, fine-grained analyzer of LLMs'\nthought process to bridge the gap, TRACE. We first benchmark the overthinking\nissue, confirming that long-thinking models are five to twenty times slower on\nsimple tasks with no substantial gains. We then use TRACE to first decompose\nthe thought process into minimally complete sub-thoughts. Next, by inferring\ndiscourse relationships among sub-thoughts, we construct granular thought\nprogression graphs and subsequently identify common thinking patterns for\ntopically similar queries. Our analysis reveals two major patterns for\nopen-weight thinking models -- Explorer and Late Landing. This finding provides\nevidence that over-verification and over-exploration are the primary drivers of\noverthinking in LLMs. Grounded in thought structures, we propose a\nutility-based definition of overthinking, which moves beyond length-based\nmetrics.

The feedback agent is deployed together with the conversation agent\nand only engages adaptively when needed, preserving helpfulness and low latency\non safe queries. Our experiments, conducted across five diverse datasets,\ndemonstrate that WaltzRL significantly reduces both unsafe responses (e.g.,\nfrom 39.0% to 4.6% on WildJailbreak) and overrefusals (from 45.3% to 9.9% on\nOR-Bench) compared to various baselines.

We present VersionRAG, a version-aware RAG framework that explicitly\nmodels document evolution through a hierarchical graph structure capturing\nversion sequences, content boundaries, and changes between document states.\nDuring retrieval, VersionRAG routes queries through specialized paths based on\nintent classification, enabling precise version-aware filtering and change\ntracking. On our VersionQA benchmark-100 manually curated questions across 34\nversioned technical documents-VersionRAG achieves 90% accuracy, outperforming\nnaive RAG (58%) and GraphRAG (64%). VersionRAG reaches 60% accuracy on implicit\nchange detection where baselines fail (0-10%), demonstrating its ability to\ntrack undocumented modifications. Additionally, VersionRAG requires 97% fewer\ntokens during indexing than GraphRAG, making it practical for large-scale\ndeployment. Our work establishes versioned document QA as a distinct task and\nprovides both a solution and benchmark for future research."}

Our work includes three\nkey technical contributions. First, we propose ReMixer, a new data synthesis\nmethod that overcomes the triviality problem prevalent in previous synthetic\ndatasets, enabling large-scale production of 82K high-quality training samples.\nSecond, we design Redapter, a self-adaptive learning algorithm that dynamically\nadjusts training each sample's weight based on its reasoning intensity. This\nallows the model to effectively capture the complex semantic relationships\nbetween queries and documents. Third, we implement ReasonEmbed across multiple\nbackbones of varying sizes, all of which achieve superior performance on\nreasoning-intensive retrieval tasks. Notably, our ReasonEmbed-Qwen3-8B model\noffers a record-high nDCG@10 score of 38.1 on the BRIGHT benchmark, which\nsignificantly outperforms existing text embedding models. We will fully\nopen-source our created resources in ReasonEmbed to push forward the research\nadvancement in this field."}
