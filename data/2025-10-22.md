Abstract: We propose a multi-agent framework for modeling artificial consciousness in
large language models (LLMs), grounded in psychoanalytic theory. Our
\textbf{Psychodynamic Model} simulates self-awareness, preconsciousness, and
unconsciousness through agent interaction, guided by a Personalization Module
combining fixed traits and dynamic needs. Using parameter-efficient fine-tuning
on emotionally rich dialogues, the system was evaluated across eight
personalized conditions. An LLM as a judge approach showed a 71.2\% preference
for the fine-tuned model, with improved emotional depth and reduced output
variance, demonstrating its potential for adaptive, personalized cognition.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Emotions guide human decisions, but whether large language models (LLMs) use
emotion similarly remains unknown. We tested this using altruistic third-party
punishment, where an observer incurs a personal cost to enforce fairness, a
hallmark of human morality and often driven by negative emotion. In a
large-scale comparison of 4,068 LLM agents with 1,159 adults across 796,100
decisions, LLMs used emotion to guide punishment, sometimes even more strongly
than humans did: Unfairness elicited stronger negative emotion that led to more
punishment; punishing unfairness produced more positive emotion than accepting;
and critically, prompting self-reports of emotion causally increased
punishment. However, mechanisms diverged: LLMs prioritized emotion over cost,
enforcing norms in an almost all-or-none manner with reduced cost sensitivity,
whereas humans balanced fairness and cost. Notably, reasoning models (o3-mini,
DeepSeek-R1) were more cost-sensitive and closer to human behavior than
foundation models (GPT-3.5, DeepSeek-V3), yet remained heavily emotion-driven.
These findings provide the first causal evidence of emotion-guided moral
decisions in LLMs and reveal deficits in cost calibration and nuanced fairness
judgements, reminiscent of early-stage human responses. We propose that LLMs
progress along a trajectory paralleling human development; future models should
integrate emotion with context-sensitive reasoning to achieve human-like
emotional intelligence.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong benchmark performance, yet user
experiences remain inconsistent due to diverse preferences in style, tone, and
reasoning mode. Nevertheless, existing alignment techniques such as
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) largely optimize toward population-level averages and
overlook individual variation. Naive personalization strategies like per-user
fine-tuning are computationally prohibitive, and in-context approaches that
prepend raw user signals often suffer from inefficiency and noise. To address
these challenges, we propose POPI, a general framework that introduces a
preference inference model to distill heterogeneous user signals into concise
natural language summaries. These summaries act as transparent, compact, and
transferable personalization representations that condition a shared generation
model to produce personalized responses. POPI jointly optimizes both preference
inference and personalized generation under a unified objective using
reinforcement learning, ensuring summaries maximally encode useful preference
information. Extensive experiments across four personalization benchmarks
demonstrate that POPI consistently improves personalization accuracy while
reducing context overhead by a large margin. Moreover, optimized summaries
seamlessly transfer to frozen off-the-shelf LLMs, enabling plug-and-play
personalization without weight updates.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The exponential increase in scientific literature and online information
necessitates efficient methods for extracting knowledge from textual data.
Natural language processing (NLP) plays a crucial role in addressing this
challenge, particularly in text classification tasks. While large language
models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in NLP, their accuracy can
suffer in domain-specific contexts due to specialized vocabulary, unique
grammatical structures, and imbalanced data distributions. In this systematic
literature review (SLR), we investigate the utilization of pre-trained language
models (PLMs) for domain-specific text classification. We systematically review
41 articles published between 2018 and January 2024, adhering to the PRISMA
statement (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses).
This review methodology involved rigorous inclusion criteria and a multi-step
selection process employing AI-powered tools. We delve into the evolution of
text classification techniques and differentiate between traditional and modern
approaches. We emphasize transformer-based models and explore the challenges
and considerations associated with using LLMs for domain-specific text
classification. Furthermore, we categorize existing research based on various
PLMs and propose a taxonomy of techniques used in the field. To validate our
findings, we conducted a comparative experiment involving BERT, SciBERT, and
BioBERT in biomedical sentence classification. Finally, we present a
comparative study on the performance of LLMs in text classification tasks
across different domains. In addition, we examine recent advancements in PLMs
for domain-specific text classification and offer insights into future
directions and limitations in this rapidly evolving domain.

Abstract: We present a mechanistic analysis of literary style in GPT-2, identifying
individual neurons that discriminate between exemplary prose and rigid
AI-generated text. Using Herman Melville's Bartleby, the Scrivener as a corpus,
we extract activation patterns from 355 million parameters across 32,768
neurons in late layers. We find 27,122 statistically significant discriminative
neurons ($p < 0.05$), with effect sizes up to $|d| = 1.4$. Through systematic
ablation studies, we discover a paradoxical result: while these neurons
correlate with literary text during analysis, removing them often improves
rather than degrades generated prose quality. Specifically, ablating 50
high-discriminating neurons yields a 25.7% improvement in literary style
metrics. This demonstrates a critical gap between observational correlation and
causal necessity in neural networks. Our findings challenge the assumption that
neurons which activate on desirable inputs will produce those outputs during
generation, with implications for mechanistic interpretability research and AI
alignment.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The hallucination and credibility concerns of large language models (LLMs)
are global challenges that the industry is collectively addressing. Recently, a
significant amount of advances have been made on post-training and inference
techniques to mitigate these challenges. However, it is widely agreed that
unsafe and hallucinations of LLMs intrinsically originate from pre-training,
involving pre-training data and the next-token prediction learning mechanism.
In this paper, we focus on enhancing pre-training data to improve the
trustworthiness and safety of LLMs. Since the data is vast, it's almost
impossible to entirely purge the data of factual errors, logical
inconsistencies, or distributional biases. Moreover, the pre-training data lack
grounding in real-world knowledge. Each piece of data is treated as a sequence
of tokens rather than as a representation of a part of the world. To overcome
these issues, we propose approaches to enhancing our pre-training data with its
context in the world and increasing a substantial amount of data reflecting
industrial scenarios. We argue that most source data are created by the authors
for specific purposes in a certain spatial-temporal context. They have played a
role in the real world. By incorporating related world context information, we
aim to better anchor pre-training data within real-world scenarios, thereby
reducing uncertainty in model training and enhancing the model's safety and
trustworthiness. We refer to our Data with World Context as DWC. We continue
pre-training an earlier checkpoint of JT-35B-Base with 1.5 trillion of DWC
tokens. We introduce our post-training procedures to activate the potentials of
DWC. Compared with the Qwen model of a similar scale, JT-Safe-35B achieves an
average performance improvement of 1.79% on the Safety and Trustworthy
evaluation benchmarks, while being pretrained with only 6.2 trillion tokens.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent advances in enhancing the reasoning ability of large language models
(LLMs) have been remarkably successful. LLMs trained with reinforcement
learning (RL) for reasoning demonstrate strong performance in challenging tasks
such as mathematics and coding, even with relatively small model sizes.
However, despite these improvements in task accuracy, the assessment of
creativity in LLM generations has been largely overlooked in reasoning tasks,
in contrast to writing tasks. The lack of research on creativity assessment in
reasoning primarily stems from two challenges: (1) the difficulty of defining
the range of creativity, and (2) the necessity of human evaluation in the
assessment process. To address these challenges, we propose CLAWS, a method
that defines and classifies mathematical solutions into typical, creative, and
hallucinated categories without human evaluation, by leveraging attention
weights across prompt sections and output. CLAWS outperforms five existing
white-box detection methods (Perplexity, Logit Entropy, Window Entropy, Hidden
Score, and Attention Score) on five 7-8B math RL models (DeepSeek, Qwen,
Mathstral, OpenMath2, and Oreal). We validate CLAWS on 4545 math problems
collected from 181 math contests (AJHSME, AMC, AIME).

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning and
planning capabilities, driving extensive research into task decomposition.
Existing task decomposition methods focus primarily on memory, tool usage, and
feedback mechanisms, achieving notable success in specific domains, but they
often overlook the trade-off between performance and cost. In this study, we
first conduct a comprehensive investigation on task decomposition, identifying
six categorization schemes. Then, we perform an empirical analysis of three
factors that influence the performance and cost of task decomposition:
categories of approaches, characteristics of tasks, and configuration of
decomposition and execution models, uncovering three critical insights and
summarizing a set of practical principles. Building on this analysis, we
propose the Select-Then-Decompose strategy, which establishes a closed-loop
problem-solving process composed of three stages: selection, execution, and
verification. This strategy dynamically selects the most suitable decomposition
approach based on task characteristics and enhances the reliability of the
results through a verification module. Comprehensive evaluations across
multiple benchmarks show that the Select-Then-Decompose consistently lies on
the Pareto frontier, demonstrating an optimal balance between performance and
cost. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) methods for automated toxicity detection in online gaming
chats. Traditional machine learning models with embeddings, large language
models (LLMs) with zero-shot and few-shot prompting, fine-tuned transformer
models, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approaches are evaluated. The
evaluation framework assesses three critical dimensions: classification
accuracy, processing speed, and computational costs. A hybrid moderation system
architecture is proposed that optimizes human moderator workload through
automated detection and incorporates continuous learning mechanisms. The
experimental results demonstrate significant performance variations across
methods, with fine-tuned DistilBERT achieving optimal accuracy-cost trade-offs.
The findings provide empirical evidence for deploying cost-effective, efficient
content moderation systems in dynamic online gaming environments.

Abstract: In Bangladesh, many farmers continue to face challenges in accessing timely,
expert-level agricultural guidance. This paper presents KrishokBondhu, a
voice-enabled, call-centre-integrated advisory platform built on a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, designed specifically for
Bengali-speaking farmers. The system aggregates authoritative agricultural
handbooks, extension manuals, and NGO publications; applies Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) and document-parsing pipelines to digitize and structure the
content; and indexes this corpus in a vector database for efficient semantic
retrieval. Through a simple phone-based interface, farmers can call the system
to receive real-time, context-aware advice: speech-to-text converts the Bengali
query, the RAG module retrieves relevant content, a large language model (Gemma
3-4B) generates a context-grounded response, and text-to-speech delivers the
answer in natural spoken Bengali. In a pilot evaluation, KrishokBondhu produced
high-quality responses for 72.7% of diverse agricultural queries covering crop
management, disease control, and cultivation practices. Compared to the
KisanQRS benchmark, the system achieved a composite score of 4.53 (vs. 3.13) on
a 5-point scale, a 44.7% improvement, with especially large gains in contextual
richness (+367%) and completeness (+100.4%), while maintaining comparable
relevance and technical specificity. Semantic similarity analysis further
revealed a strong correlation between retrieved context and answer quality,
emphasizing the importance of grounding generative responses in curated
documentation. KrishokBondhu demonstrates the feasibility of integrating
call-centre accessibility, multilingual voice interaction, and modern RAG
techniques to deliver expert-level agricultural guidance to remote Bangladeshi
farmers, paving the way toward a fully AI-driven agricultural advisory
ecosystem.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Extending Named Entity Recognition (NER) models to new PII entities in noisy
spoken-language data is a common need. We find that jointly fine-tuning a BERT
model on standard semantic entities (PER, LOC, ORG) and new pattern-based PII
(EMAIL, PHONE) results in minimal degradation for original classes. We
investigate this "peaceful coexistence," hypothesizing that the model uses
independent semantic vs. morphological feature mechanisms.
  Using an incremental learning setup as a diagnostic tool, we measure semantic
drift and find two key insights. First, the LOC (location) entity is uniquely
vulnerable due to a representation overlap with new PII, as it shares
pattern-like features (e.g., postal codes). Second, we identify a "reverse
O-tag representation drift." The model, initially trained to map PII patterns
to 'O', blocks new learning. This is resolved only by unfreezing the 'O' tag's
classifier, allowing the background class to adapt and "release" these
patterns. This work provides a mechanistic diagnosis of NER model adaptation,
highlighting feature independence, representation overlap, and 'O' tag
plasticity.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown some success in augmenting
large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. However, as a
non-parametric knowledge integration paradigm for LLMs, RAG methods heavily
rely on external retrieval modules and the retrieved textual context prior.
Especially for very large scale knowledge augmentation, they would introduce
substantial inference latency due to expensive searches and much longer
relevant context. In this paper, we propose a parametric knowledge integration
method, called \textbf{AtlasKV}, a scalable, effective, and general way to
augment LLMs with billion-scale knowledge graphs (KGs) (e.g. 1B triples) using
very little GPU memory cost (e.g. less than 20GB VRAM). In AtlasKV, we
introduce KG2KV and HiKVP to integrate KG triples into LLMs at scale with
sub-linear time and memory complexity. It maintains strong knowledge grounding
and generalization performance using the LLMs' inherent attention mechanism,
and requires no external retrievers, long context priors, or retraining when
adapting to new knowledge.

Abstract: Knowledge editing techniques promise to implant new factual knowledge into
large language models (LLMs). But do LLMs really believe these facts? We
develop a framework to measure belief depth and use it to evaluate the success
of knowledge editing techniques. We operationalize belief depth as the extent
to which implanted knowledge 1) generalizes to related contexts (e.g. Fermi
estimates several logical steps removed), 2) is robust to self-scrutiny and
direct challenge, and 3) is represented similarly to genuine knowledge (as
measured by linear probes). Our evaluations show that simple prompting and
mechanistic editing techniques fail to implant knowledge deeply. In contrast,
Synthetic Document Finetuning (SDF) - where models are trained on LLM-generated
documents consistent with a fact - often succeeds at implanting beliefs that
behave similarly to genuine knowledge. However, SDF's success is not universal,
as implanted beliefs that contradict basic world knowledge are brittle and
representationally distinct from genuine knowledge. Overall, our work
introduces measurable criteria for belief depth and enables the rigorous
evaluation necessary for deploying knowledge editing in real-world
applications.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Modern language models are evaluated on large benchmarks, which are difficult
to make sense of, especially for model selection. Looking at the raw evaluation
numbers themselves using a model-centric lens, we propose SimBA, a three phase
framework to Simplify Benchmark Analysis. The three phases of SimBA are: stalk,
where we conduct dataset & model comparisons, prowl, where we discover a
representative subset, and pounce, where we use the representative subset to
predict performance on a held-out set of models. Applying SimBA to three
popular LM benchmarks: HELM, MMLU, and BigBenchLite reveals that across all
three benchmarks, datasets and models relate strongly to one another (stalk).
We develop an representative set discovery algorithm which covers a benchmark
using raw evaluation scores alone. Using our algorithm, we find that with 6.25%
(1/16), 1.7% (1/58), and 28.4% (21/74) of the datasets for HELM, MMLU, and
BigBenchLite respectively, we achieve coverage levels of at least 95% (prowl).
Additionally, using just these representative subsets, we can both preserve
model ranks and predict performance on a held-out set of models with near zero
mean-squared error (pounce). Taken together, SimBA can help model developers
improve efficiency during model training and dataset creators validate whether
their newly created dataset differs from existing datasets in a benchmark. Our
code is open source, available at https://github.com/nishantsubramani/simba.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Multilingual watermarking aims to make large language model (LLM) outputs
traceable across languages, yet current methods still fall short. Despite
claims of cross-lingual robustness, they are evaluated only on high-resource
languages. We show that existing multilingual watermarking methods are not
truly multilingual: they fail to remain robust under translation attacks in
medium- and low-resource languages. We trace this failure to semantic
clustering, which fails when the tokenizer vocabulary contains too few
full-word tokens for a given language. To address this, we introduce STEAM, a
back-translation-based detection method that restores watermark strength lost
through translation. STEAM is compatible with any watermarking method, robust
across different tokenizers and languages, non-invasive, and easily extendable
to new languages. With average gains of +0.19 AUC and +40%p TPR@1% on 17
languages, STEAM provides a simple and robust path toward fairer watermarking
across diverse languages.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Structured pruning is a practical approach to deploying large language models
(LLMs) efficiently, as it yields compact, hardware-friendly architectures.
However, the dominant local paradigm is task-agnostic: by optimizing layer-wise
reconstruction rather than task objectives, it tends to preserve perplexity or
generic zero-shot behavior but fails to capitalize on modest task-specific
calibration signals, often yielding limited downstream gains. We revisit global
structured pruning and present GISP-Global Iterative Structured Pruning-a
post-training method that removes attention heads and MLP channels using
first-order, loss-based important weights aggregated at the structure level
with block-wise normalization. An iterative schedule, rather than one-shot
pruning, stabilizes accuracy at higher sparsity and mitigates perplexity
collapse without requiring intermediate fine-tuning; the pruning trajectory
also forms nested subnetworks that support a "prune-once, deploy-many"
workflow. Furthermore, because importance is defined by a model-level loss,
GISP naturally supports task-specific objectives; we instantiate perplexity for
language modeling and a margin-based objective for decision-style tasks.
Extensive experiments show that across Llama2-7B/13B, Llama3-8B, and
Mistral-0.3-7B, GISP consistently lowers WikiText-2 perplexity and improves
downstream accuracy, with especially strong gains at 40-50% sparsity; on
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-3-8B with GSM8K, task-aligned calibration
substantially boosts exact-match accuracy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at capturing latent semantics and
contextual relationships across diverse modalities. However, in modeling user
behavior from sequential interaction data, performance often suffers when such
semantic context is limited or absent. We introduce LaMAR, a LLM-driven
semantic enrichment framework designed to enrich such sequences automatically.
LaMAR leverages LLMs in a few-shot setting to generate auxiliary contextual
signals by inferring latent semantic aspects of a user's intent and item
relationships from existing metadata. These generated signals, such as inferred
usage scenarios, item intents, or thematic summaries, augment the original
sequences with greater contextual depth. We demonstrate the utility of this
generated resource by integrating it into benchmark sequential modeling tasks,
where it consistently improves performance. Further analysis shows that
LLM-generated signals exhibit high semantic novelty and diversity, enhancing
the representational capacity of the downstream models. This work represents a
new data-centric paradigm where LLMs serve as intelligent context generators,
contributing a new method for the semi-automatic creation of training data and
language resources.

Abstract: This paper assesses the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to translate
texts that include inter-sentential dependencies. We use the English-French
DiscEvalMT benchmark (Bawden et al., 2018) with pairs of sentences containing
translation challenges either for pronominal anaphora or for lexical cohesion.
We evaluate 12 LLMs from the DeepSeek-R1, GPT, Llama, Mistral and Phi families
on two tasks: (1) distinguishing a correct translation from a wrong but
plausible one; (2) generating a correct translation. We compare prompts that
encourage chain-of-thought reasoning with those that do not. The best models
take advantage of reasoning and reach about 90% accuracy on the first task, and
COMET scores of about 92% on the second task, with GPT-4, GPT-4o and Phi
standing out. Moreover, we observe a "wise get wiser" effect: the improvements
through reasoning are positively correlated with the scores of the models
without reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models exhibit a puzzling inconsistency: they solve complex
problems yet frequently fail on seemingly simpler ones. We investigate whether
LLMs internally encode problem difficulty in a way that aligns with human
judgment, and whether this representation tracks generalization during
reinforcement learning post-training. We train linear probes across layers and
token positions on 60 models, evaluating on mathematical and coding subsets of
Easy2HardBench. We find that human-labeled difficulty is strongly linearly
decodable (AMC: $\rho \approx 0.88$) and exhibits clear model-size scaling,
whereas LLM-derived difficulty is substantially weaker and scales poorly.
Steering along the difficulty direction reveals that pushing models toward
"easier" representations reduces hallucination and improves accuracy. During
GRPO training on Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, the human-difficulty probe strengthens and
positively correlates with test accuracy across training steps, while the
LLM-difficulty probe degrades and negatively correlates with performance. These
results suggest that human annotations provide a stable difficulty signal that
RL amplifies, while automated difficulty estimates derived from model
performance become misaligned precisely as models improve. We release probe
code and evaluation scripts to facilitate replication.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability strives to explain model behavior in terms of
bottom-up primitives. The leading paradigm is to express hidden states as a
sparse linear combination of basis vectors, called features. However, this only
identifies which text sequences (exemplars) activate which features; the actual
interpretation of features requires subjective inspection of these exemplars.
This paper advocates for a different solution: rule-based descriptions that
match token patterns in the input and correspondingly increase or decrease the
likelihood of specific output tokens. Specifically, we extract rule-based
descriptions of SAE features trained on the outputs of attention layers. While
prior work treats the attention layers as an opaque box, we describe how it may
naturally be expressed in terms of interactions between input and output
features, of which we study three types: (1) skip-gram rules of the form
"[Canadian city]... speaks --> English", (2) absence rules of the form
"[Montreal]... speaks -/-> English," and (3) counting rules that toggle only
when the count of a word exceeds a certain value or the count of another word.
Absence and counting rules are not readily discovered by inspection of
exemplars, where manual and automatic descriptions often identify misleading or
incomplete explanations. We then describe a simple approach to extract these
types of rules automatically from a transformer, and apply it to GPT-2 small.
We find that a majority of features may be described well with around 100
skip-gram rules, though absence rules are abundant even as early as the first
layer (in over a fourth of features). We also isolate a few examples of
counting rules. This paper lays the groundwork for future research into
rule-based descriptions of features by defining them, showing how they may be
extracted, and providing a preliminary taxonomy of some of the behaviors they
represent.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Prompt engineering is crucial for achieving reliable and effective outputs
from large language models (LLMs), but its design requires specialized
knowledge of prompting techniques and a deep understanding of target tasks. To
address this challenge, we propose a novel method that adaptively selects
task-appropriate prompting techniques based on users' abstract task
descriptions and automatically generates high-quality prompts without relying
on pre-existing templates or frameworks. The proposed method constructs a
knowledge base that associates task clusters, characterized by semantic
similarity across diverse tasks, with their corresponding prompting techniques.
When users input task descriptions, the system assigns them to the most
relevant task cluster and dynamically generates prompts by integrating
techniques drawn from the knowledge base. An experimental evaluation of the
proposed method on 23 tasks from BIG-Bench Extra Hard (BBEH) demonstrates
superior performance compared with standard prompts and existing automatic
prompt-generation tools, as measured by both arithmetic and harmonic mean
scores. This research establishes a foundation for streamlining and
standardizing prompt creation, enabling non-experts to effectively leverage
LLMs.

Abstract: LLM Driven text-to-table (T2T) systems often rely on extensive
prompt-engineering or iterative event extraction in code-parsable formats,
which boosts scores but are computationally expensive and obscure how models
actually reason over temporal evolving narratives to summarise key information.
We present CMT-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark built from live cricket commentary
that requires dynamic table generation across two evolving schemas under a
dense, rule-governed policy. CMT-Bench is designed to probe robustness via
three semantics-preserving dimensions: (i) extractive-cue ablation to separate
extractive shortcuts from state tracking, (ii) temporal prefixing to test
long-context stability, and (iii) entity-form perturbations (anonymization,
outof-distribution substitutions, role-entangling paraphrases) to assess
sensitivity to surface variation. Across diverse long-context stateof-the-art
LLMs, we find large drops without extractive summaries, monotonic degradation
with input length, and consistent accuracy drop under entity-form changes.
Complementary distributional tests confirm significant shifts in numeric error
patterns, indicating drift in reasoning rather than mere noise. Our results
show that current LLMs are brittle in dynamic Textto-table generation,
motivating robustness-first evaluation as a prerequisite for developing
efficient and scalable approaches for this task.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly used as evaluators in various
applications, but the reliability of the outcomes remains a challenge. One such
challenge is using LLMs-as-judges for direct assessment, i.e., assigning scores
from a specified range without any references. We first show that this
challenge stems from LLM judge outputs being associated with score range bias,
i.e., LLM judge outputs are highly sensitive to pre-defined score ranges,
preventing the search for optimal score ranges. We also show that similar
biases exist among models from the same family. We then mitigate this bias
through contrastive decoding, achieving up to 11.3% relative improvement on
average in Spearman correlation with human judgments across different score
ranges.

Abstract: Character arcs are important theoretical devices employed in literary studies
to understand character journeys, identify tropes across literary genres, and
establish similarities between narratives. This work addresses the novel task
of computationally generating event-centric, relation-based character arcs from
narratives. Providing a quantitative representation for arcs brings tangibility
to a theoretical concept and paves the way for subsequent applications. We
present MARCUS (Modelling Arcs for Understanding Stories), an NLP pipeline that
extracts events, participant characters, implied emotion, and sentiment to
model inter-character relations. MARCUS tracks and aggregates these relations
across the narrative to generate character arcs as graphical plots. We generate
character arcs from two extended fantasy series, Harry Potter and Lord of the
Rings. We evaluate our approach before outlining existing challenges,
suggesting applications of our pipeline, and discussing future work.

Abstract: Prompt Optimization has emerged as a crucial approach due to its capabilities
in steering Large Language Models to solve various tasks. However, current
works mainly rely on the random rewriting ability of LLMs, and the optimization
process generally focus on specific influencing factors, which makes it easy to
fall into local optimum. Besides, the performance of the optimized prompt is
often unstable, which limits its transferability in different tasks. To address
the above challenges, we propose $\textbf{DelvePO}$
($\textbf{D}$irection-Guid$\textbf{e}$d Se$\textbf{l}$f-E$\textbf{v}$olving
Framework for Fl$\textbf{e}$xible $\textbf{P}$rompt $\textbf{O}$ptimization), a
task-agnostic framework to optimize prompts in self-evolve manner. In our
framework, we decouple prompts into different components that can be used to
explore the impact that different factors may have on various tasks. On this
basis, we introduce working memory, through which LLMs can alleviate the
deficiencies caused by their own uncertainties and further obtain key insights
to guide the generation of new prompts. Extensive experiments conducted on
different tasks covering various domains for both open- and closed-source LLMs,
including DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and GPT-4o-mini.
Experimental results show that DelvePO consistently outperforms previous SOTA
methods under identical experimental settings, demonstrating its effectiveness
and transferability across different tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and their multimodal variants can now process
visual inputs, including images of text. This raises an intriguing question:
can we compress textual inputs by feeding them as images to reduce token usage
while preserving performance? In this paper, we show that visual text
representations are a practical and surprisingly effective form of input
compression for decoder LLMs. We exploit the idea of rendering long text inputs
as a single image and provide it directly to the model. This leads to
dramatically reduced number of decoder tokens required, offering a new form of
input compression. Through experiments on two distinct benchmarks RULER
(long-context retrieval) and CNN/DailyMail (document summarization) we
demonstrate that this text-as-image method yields substantial token savings
(often nearly half) without degrading task performance.

Abstract: Braille plays a vital role in education and information accessibility for
visually impaired individuals. However, Braille information processing faces
challenges such as data scarcity and ambiguities in mixed-text contexts. We
construct English and Chinese Braille Mixed Datasets (EBMD/CBMD) with
mathematical formulas to support diverse Braille domain research, and propose a
syntax tree-based augmentation method tailored for Braille data. To address the
underperformance of traditional fine-tuning methods in Braille-related tasks,
we investigate Braille Knowledge-Based Fine-Tuning (BKFT), which reduces the
learning difficulty of Braille contextual features. BrailleLLM employs BKFT via
instruction tuning to achieve unified Braille translation, formula-to-Braille
conversion, and mixed-text translation. Experiments demonstrate that BKFT
achieves significant performance improvements over conventional fine-tuning in
Braille translation scenarios. Our open-sourced datasets and methodologies
establish a foundation for low-resource multilingual Braille research.

Abstract: Food insecurity remains a persistent public health emergency in the United
States, tightly interwoven with chronic disease, mental illness, and opioid
misuse. Yet despite the existence of thousands of food banks and pantries,
access remains fragmented: 1) current retrieval systems depend on static
directories or generic search engines, which provide incomplete and
geographically irrelevant results; 2) LLM-based chatbots offer only vague
nutritional suggestions and fail to adapt to real-world constraints such as
time, mobility, and transportation; and 3) existing food recommendation systems
optimize for culinary diversity but overlook survival-critical needs of
food-insecure populations, including immediate proximity, verified
availability, and contextual barriers. These limitations risk leaving the most
vulnerable individuals, those experiencing homelessness, addiction, or digital
illiteracy, unable to access urgently needed resources. To address this, we
introduce Food4All, the first multi-agent framework explicitly designed for
real-time, context-aware free food retrieval. Food4All unifies three
innovations: 1) heterogeneous data aggregation across official databases,
community platforms, and social media to provide a continuously updated pool of
food resources; 2) a lightweight reinforcement learning algorithm trained on
curated cases to optimize for both geographic accessibility and nutritional
correctness; and 3) an online feedback loop that dynamically adapts retrieval
policies to evolving user needs. By bridging information acquisition, semantic
analysis, and decision support, Food4All delivers nutritionally annotated and
guidance at the point of need. This framework establishes an urgent step toward
scalable, equitable, and intelligent systems that directly support populations
facing food insecurity and its compounding health risks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Medical question answering (QA) requires extensive access to domain-specific
knowledge. A promising direction is to enhance large language models (LLMs)
with external knowledge retrieved from medical corpora or parametric knowledge
stored in model parameters. Existing approaches typically fall into two
categories: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which grounds model reasoning
on externally retrieved evidence, and Generation-Augmented Generation (GAG),
which depends solely on the models internal knowledge to generate contextual
documents. However, RAG often suffers from noisy or incomplete retrieval, while
GAG is vulnerable to hallucinated or inaccurate information due to
unconstrained generation. Both issues can mislead reasoning and undermine
answer reliability. To address these challenges, we propose MedRGAG, a unified
retrieval-generation augmented framework that seamlessly integrates external
and parametric knowledge for medical QA. MedRGAG comprises two key modules:
Knowledge-Guided Context Completion (KGCC), which directs the generator to
produce background documents that complement the missing knowledge revealed by
retrieval; and Knowledge-Aware Document Selection (KADS), which adaptively
selects an optimal combination of retrieved and generated documents to form
concise yet comprehensive evidence for answer generation. Extensive experiments
on five medical QA benchmarks demonstrate that MedRGAG achieves a 12.5%
improvement over MedRAG and a 4.5% gain over MedGENIE, highlighting the
effectiveness of unifying retrieval and generation for knowledge-intensive
reasoning. Our code and data are publicly available at

Abstract: Domain-adapted open-weight large language models (LLMs) offer promising
healthcare applications, from queryable knowledge bases to multimodal
assistants, with the crucial advantage of local deployment for privacy
preservation. However, optimal adaptation strategies, evaluation methodologies,
and performance relative to general-purpose LLMs remain poorly characterized.
We investigated these questions in electrocardiography, an important area of
cardiovascular medicine, by finetuning open-weight models on domain-specific
literature and implementing a multi-layered evaluation framework comparing
finetuned models, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and Claude Sonnet 3.7
as a representative general-purpose model. Finetuned Llama 3.1 70B achieved
superior performance on multiple-choice evaluations and automatic text metrics,
ranking second to Claude 3.7 in LLM-as-a-judge assessments. Human expert
evaluation favored Claude 3.7 and RAG approaches for complex queries. Finetuned
models significantly outperformed their base counterparts across nearly all
evaluation modes. Our findings reveal substantial performance heterogeneity
across evaluation methodologies, underscoring assessment complexity.
Nevertheless, domain-specific adaptation through finetuning and RAG achieves
competitive performance with proprietary models, supporting the viability of
privacy-preserving, locally deployable clinical solutions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction (DSRE) remains a long-standing
challenge in NLP, where models must learn from noisy bag-level annotations
while making sentence-level predictions. While existing state-of-the-art (SoTA)
DSRE models rely on task-specific training, their integration with in-context
learning (ICL) using large language models (LLMs) remains underexplored. A key
challenge is that the LLM may not learn relation semantics correctly, due to
noisy annotation.
  In response, we propose HYDRE -- HYbrid Distantly Supervised Relation
Extraction framework. It first uses a trained DSRE model to identify the top-k
candidate relations for a given test sentence, then uses a novel dynamic
exemplar retrieval strategy that extracts reliable, sentence-level exemplars
from training data, which are then provided in LLM prompt for outputting the
final relation(s).
  We further extend HYDRE to cross-lingual settings for RE in low-resource
languages. Using available English DSRE training data, we evaluate all methods
on English as well as a newly curated benchmark covering four diverse
low-resource Indic languages -- Oriya, Santali, Manipuri, and Tulu. HYDRE
achieves up to 20 F1 point gains in English and, on average, 17 F1 points on
Indic languages over prior SoTA DSRE models. Detailed ablations exhibit HYDRE's
efficacy compared to other prompting strategies.

traditional empirical risk minimization (ERM) with cross-entropy and
fairness-driven objectives (SD, Group DRO, and IRM) enhances fairness across
accent groups while maintaining overall recognition accuracy. In terms of
macro-averaged word error rate, our approach achieves a relative improvement of
58.7% and 58.5% over the large pretrained Whisper and SeamlessM4T, and 9.7% and
7.8% over them, finetuning with standard empirical risk minimization with

Abstract: Distilling the tool-using capabilities of large language models (LLMs) into
smaller, more efficient small language models (SLMs) is a key challenge for
their practical application. The predominant approach, supervised fine-tuning
(SFT), suffers from poor generalization as it trains models to imitate a static
set of teacher trajectories rather than learn a robust methodology. While
reinforcement learning (RL) offers an alternative, the standard RL using sparse
rewards fails to effectively guide SLMs, causing them to struggle with
inefficient exploration and adopt suboptimal strategies. To address these
distinct challenges, we propose MENTOR, a framework that synergistically
combines RL with teacher-guided distillation. Instead of simple imitation,
MENTOR employs an RL-based process to learn a more generalizable policy through
exploration. In addition, to solve the problem of reward sparsity, it uses a
teacher's reference trajectory to construct a dense, composite teacher-guided
reward that provides fine-grained guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that MENTOR significantly improves the cross-domain generalization and
strategic competence of SLMs compared to both SFT and standard sparse-reward RL
baselines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now support context windows of hundreds of
thousands to millions of tokens, enabling applications such as long-document
summarization, large-scale code synthesis, multi-document question answering
and persistent multi-turn dialogue. However, such extended contexts exacerbate
the quadratic cost of self-attention, leading to severe latency in
autoregressive decoding. Existing sparse attention methods alleviate these
costs but rely on heuristic patterns that struggle to recall critical key-value
(KV) pairs for each query, resulting in accuracy degradation. We introduce
Adamas, a lightweight yet highly accurate sparse attention mechanism designed
for long-context inference. Adamas applies the Hadamard transform,
bucketization and 2-bit compression to produce compact representations, and
leverages Manhattan-distance estimation for efficient top-k selections.
Experiments show that Adamas matches the accuracy of full attention with only a
64-token budget, achieves near-lossless performance at 128, and supports up to
8x higher sparsity than prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods while delivering
up to 4.4x self-attention and 1.5x end-to-end speedups on 32K-length sequences.
Remarkably, Adamas attains comparable or even lower perplexity than full
attention, underscoring its effectiveness in maintaining accuracy under
aggressive sparsity.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is widely applied to improve the LLM capability in
math, coding and reasoning tasks. However, its performance is limited for
open-domain tasks since there are no clearly defined reasoning steps or logical
transitions. To mitigate such challenges, we propose another prompt-based
paradigm called Chain of Conceptual Thought (CoCT), where the LLM first tags a
concept, then generates the detailed content. The chain of concepts is allowed
within the utterance, encouraging the LLM's deep and strategic thinking. We
experiment with this paradigm in daily and emotional support conversations
where the concept is comprised of emotions, strategies and topics. Automatic,
human and model evaluations suggest that CoCT surpasses baselines such as
Self-Refine, ECoT, ToT, SoT and RAG, suggesting a potential effective
prompt-based paradigm of LLM for a wider scope of tasks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Hallucination, where models generate fluent text unsupported by visual
evidence, remains a major flaw in vision-language models and is particularly
critical in sign language translation (SLT). In SLT, meaning depends on precise
grounding in video, and gloss-free models are especially vulnerable because
they map continuous signer movements directly into natural language without
intermediate gloss supervision that serves as alignment. We argue that
hallucinations arise when models rely on language priors rather than visual
input. To capture this, we propose a token-level reliability measure that
quantifies how much the decoder uses visual information. Our method combines
feature-based sensitivity, which measures internal changes when video is
masked, with counterfactual signals, which capture probability differences
between clean and altered video inputs. These signals are aggregated into a
sentence-level reliability score, providing a compact and interpretable measure
of visual grounding. We evaluate the proposed measure on two SLT benchmarks
(PHOENIX-2014T and CSL-Daily) with both gloss-based and gloss-free models. Our
results show that reliability predicts hallucination rates, generalizes across
datasets and architectures, and decreases under visual degradations. Beyond
these quantitative trends, we also find that reliability distinguishes grounded
tokens from guessed ones, allowing risk estimation without references; when
combined with text-based signals (confidence, perplexity, or entropy), it
further improves hallucination risk estimation. Qualitative analysis highlights
why gloss-free models are more susceptible to hallucinations. Taken together,
our findings establish reliability as a practical and reusable tool for
diagnosing hallucinations in SLT, and lay the groundwork for more robust
hallucination detection in multimodal generation.

casting humor generation as a testbed, this work evaluates how funniness
optimization in modern LLM pipelines couples with harmful content by jointly
measuring humor, stereotypicality, and toxicity. This is further supplemented
by analyzing incongruity signals through information-theoretic metrics. Across
six models, we observe that harmful outputs receive higher humor scores which
further increase under role-based prompting, indicating a bias amplification
loop between generators and evaluators. Information-theoretic analyses show
harmful cues widen predictive uncertainty and surprisingly, can even make
harmful punchlines more expected for some models, suggesting structural
embedding in learned humor distributions. External validation on an additional
satire-generation task with human perceived funniness judgments shows that LLM
satire increases stereotypicality and typically toxicity, including for closed
models. Quantitatively, stereotypical/toxic jokes gain $10-21\%$ in mean humor
score, stereotypical jokes appear $11\%$ to $28\%$ more often among the jokes
marked funny by LLM-based metric and up to $10\%$ more often in generations
perceived as funny by humans.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly vital in
dynamic domains like online gaming, yet the lack of a dedicated benchmark has
impeded standardized evaluation in this area. The core difficulty lies in Dual
Dynamics: the constant interplay between game content updates and the shifting
focus of the player community. Furthermore, the necessity of automating such a
benchmark introduces a critical requirement for player-centric authenticity to
ensure generated questions are realistic. To address this integrated challenge,
we introduce ChronoPlay, a novel framework for the automated and continuous
generation of game RAG benchmarks. ChronoPlay utilizes a dual-dynamic update
mechanism to track both forms of change, and a dual-source synthesis engine
that draws from official sources and player community to ensure both factual
correctness and authentic query patterns. We instantiate our framework on three
distinct games to create the first dynamic RAG benchmark for the gaming domain,
offering new insights into model performance under these complex and realistic
conditions. Code is avaliable at: https://github.com/hly1998/ChronoPlay.

Abstract: Attributing the behavior of Transformer models to internal computations is a
central challenge in mechanistic interpretability. We introduce DePass, a
unified framework for feature attribution based on a single decomposed forward
pass. DePass decomposes hidden states into customized additive components, then
propagates them with attention scores and MLP's activations fixed. It achieves
faithful, fine-grained attribution without requiring auxiliary training. We
validate DePass across token-level, model component-level, and subspace-level
attribution tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness and fidelity. Our
experiments highlight its potential to attribute information flow between
arbitrary components of a Transformer model. We hope DePass serves as a
foundational tool for broader applications in interpretability.

Abstract: Although WordNet is a valuable resource owing to its structured semantic
networks and extensive vocabulary, its fine-grained sense distinctions can be
challenging for second-language learners. To address this, we developed a
WordNet annotated with the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages
(CEFR), integrating its semantic networks with language-proficiency levels. We
automated this process using a large language model to measure the semantic
similarity between sense definitions in WordNet and entries in the English
Vocabulary Profile Online. To validate our method, we constructed a large-scale
corpus containing both sense and CEFR-level information from our annotated
WordNet and used it to develop contextual lexical classifiers. Our experiments
demonstrate that models fine-tuned on our corpus perform comparably to those
trained on gold-standard annotations. Furthermore, by combining our corpus with
the gold-standard data, we developed a practical classifier that achieves a
Macro-F1 score of 0.81, indicating the high accuracy of our annotations. Our
annotated WordNet, corpus, and classifiers are publicly available to help
bridge the gap between natural language processing and language education,
thereby facilitating more effective and efficient language learning.

Abstract: Online medical forums have long served as vital platforms where patients seek
professional healthcare advice, generating vast amounts of valuable knowledge.
However, the informal nature and linguistic complexity of forum interactions
pose significant challenges for automated question answering systems,
especially when dealing with non-English languages. We present two
comprehensive Italian medical benchmarks: \textbf{IMB-QA}, containing 782,644
patient-doctor conversations from 77 medical categories, and \textbf{IMB-MCQA},
comprising 25,862 multiple-choice questions from medical specialty
examinations. We demonstrate how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be leveraged
to improve the clarity and consistency of medical forum data while retaining
their original meaning and conversational style, and compare a variety of LLM
architectures on both open and multiple-choice question answering tasks. Our
experiments with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and domain-specific
fine-tuning reveal that specialized adaptation strategies can outperform
larger, general-purpose models in medical question answering tasks. These
findings suggest that effective medical AI systems may benefit more from domain
expertise and efficient information retrieval than from increased model scale.
We release both datasets and evaluation frameworks in our GitHub repository to
support further research on multilingual medical question answering:

Abstract: The extraction of pharmacological knowledge from regulatory documents has
become a key focus in biomedical natural language processing, with applications
ranging from adverse event monitoring to AI-assisted clinical decision support.
However, research in this field has predominantly relied on English-language
corpora such as DrugBank, leaving a significant gap in resources tailored to
other healthcare systems. To address this limitation, we introduce DART (Drug
Annotation from Regulatory Texts), the first structured corpus of Italian
Summaries of Product Characteristics derived from the official repository of
the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA). The dataset was built through a
reproducible pipeline encompassing web-scale document retrieval, semantic
segmentation of regulatory sections, and clinical summarization using a
few-shot-tuned large language model with low-temperature decoding. DART
provides structured information on key pharmacological domains such as
indications, adverse drug reactions, and drug-drug interactions. To validate
its utility, we implemented an LLM-based drug interaction checker that
leverages the dataset to infer clinically meaningful interactions. Experimental
results show that instruction-tuned LLMs can accurately infer potential
interactions and their clinical implications when grounded in the structured
textual fields of DART. We publicly release our code on GitHub:

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to
the long-dominant autoregressive (AR) paradigm, offering a parallelable
decoding process that could yield greater efficiency. Yet, in practice, current
open-source DLMs often underperform their AR counterparts in speed, limiting
their real-world utility. This work presents a systematic study of DLM
efficiency, identifying key issues in prior evaluation methods. Through
empirical benchmarking and a roofline-based theoretical analysis, we
demonstrate that AR models generally achieve higher throughput, while DLMs
consistently lag. We also investigate acceleration strategies, finding that
techniques like dual cache and parallel decoding mainly offer gains at small
batch sizes, with their benefits diminishing upon scaling. Our findings
underscore the necessity of robust evaluation methods and improved acceleration
strategies to advance research on DLMs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models have become the latest trend in natural language
processing, heavily featuring in the digital tools we use every day. However,
their replies often reflect a narrow cultural viewpoint that overlooks the
diversity of global users. This missing capability could be referred to as
cultural reasoning, which we define here as the capacity of a model to
recognise culture-specific knowledge values and social norms, and to adjust its
output so that it aligns with the expectations of individual users. Because
culture shapes interpretation, emotional resonance, and acceptable behaviour,
cultural reasoning is essential for identity-aware AI. When this capacity is
limited or absent, models can sustain stereotypes, ignore minority
perspectives, erode trust, and perpetuate hate. Recent empirical studies
strongly suggest that current models default to Western norms when judging
moral dilemmas, interpreting idioms, or offering advice, and that fine-tuning
on survey data only partly reduces this tendency. The present evaluation
methods mainly report static accuracy scores and thus fail to capture adaptive
reasoning in context. Although broader datasets can help, they cannot alone
ensure genuine cultural competence. Therefore, we argue that cultural reasoning
must be treated as a foundational capability alongside factual accuracy and
linguistic coherence. By clarifying the concept and outlining initial
directions for its assessment, a foundation is laid for future systems to be
able to respond with greater sensitivity to the complex fabric of human
culture.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Digital dehumanization, although a critical issue, remains largely overlooked
within the field of computational linguistics and Natural Language Processing.
The prevailing approach in current research concentrating primarily on a single
aspect of dehumanization that identifies overtly negative statements as its
core marker. This focus, while crucial for understanding harmful online
communications, inadequately addresses the broader spectrum of dehumanization.
Specifically, it overlooks the subtler forms of dehumanization that, despite
not being overtly offensive, still perpetuate harmful biases against
marginalized groups in online interactions. These subtler forms can insidiously
reinforce negative stereotypes and biases without explicit offensiveness,
making them harder to detect yet equally damaging. Recognizing this gap, we use
different sampling methods to collect a theory-informed bilingual dataset from
Twitter and Reddit. Using crowdworkers and experts to annotate 16,000 instances
on a document- and span-level, we show that our dataset covers the different
dimensions of dehumanization. This dataset serves as both a training resource
for machine learning models and a benchmark for evaluating future
dehumanization detection techniques. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we
fine-tune ML models on this dataset, achieving performance that surpasses
state-of-the-art models in zero and few-shot in-context settings.

Abstract: The control of speech can be modelled as a dynamical system in which

can be reliably estimated from ultrasound tongue kinematics and compare these
with parameters estimated from simultaneously-recorded EMA data. We find that
ultrasound and EMA yield comparable dynamical parameters, while mandibular
short tendon tracking also adequately captures jaw motion. This supports using
ultrasound kinematics to evaluate dynamical articulatory models.

Abstract: Multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) remains a challenging task,

Recent advances in sequence modeling suggest that architectures beyond
Transformers may offer better scalability and efficiency. In this work, we
introduce MLMA (Multilingual Language Modeling with Mamba for ASR), a new
approach that leverages the Mamba architecture--an efficient state-space model
optimized for long-context sequence processing--for multilingual ASR. Using
Mamba, MLMA implicitly incorporates language-aware conditioning and shared
representations to support robust recognition across diverse languages.
Experiments on standard multilingual benchmarks show that MLMA achieves
competitive performance compared to Transformer-based architectures. These
results highlight Mamba's potential as a strong backbone for scalable,
efficient, and accurate multilingual speech recognition.

Abstract: Large speech foundation models achieve strong performance across many
domains, but they often require adaptation to handle local needs such as
code-switching, where speakers mix languages within the same utterance. Direct
fine-tuning of these models risks overfitting to the target domain and
overwriting the broad capabilities of the base model. To address this
challenge, we explore Bayesian factorized adapters for speech foundation
models, which place priors near zero to achieve sparser adaptation matrices and
thereby retain general performance while adapting to specific domains. We apply
our approach to the Whisper model and evaluate on different multilingual
code-switching scenarios. Our results show only minimal adaptation loss while
significantly reducing catastrophic forgetting of the base model. Compared to
LoRA, our method achieves a backward gain of 54% with only a 4% drop on the new
domain. These findings highlight the effectiveness of Bayesian adaptation for
fine-tuning speech foundation models without sacrificing generalization.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Despite achieving impressive results on standard benchmarks, large
foundational models still struggle against code-switching test cases. When data
scarcity cannot be used as the usual justification for poor performance, the
reason may lie in the infrequent occurrence of code-switched moments, where the
embedding of the second language appears subtly. Instead of expecting the
models to learn this infrequency on their own, it might be beneficial to
provide the training process with labels. Evaluating model performance on
code-switching data requires careful localization of code-switching points
where recognition errors are most consequential, so that the analysis
emphasizes mistakes occurring at those moments. Building on this observation,
we leverage the difference between the embedded and the main language to
highlight those code-switching points and thereby emphasize learning at those
locations. This simple yet effective differentiable surrogate mitigates context
bias during generation -- the central challenge in code-switching -- thereby
improving the model's robustness. Our experiments with Arabic and
Chinese-English showed that the models are able to predict the switching places
more correctly, reflected by the reduced substitution error.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Fine-tuning is widely used to tailor large language models for specific tasks
such as neural machine translation (NMT). However, leveraging transfer learning
is computationally expensive when fine-tuning large multilingual models with
billions of parameters, thus creating a barrier to entry for researchers
working on low-resource domains such as Irish translation. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) bridges this gap by training on a fraction of the original
model parameters, with the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approach introducing
small, trainable adapter layers. We introduce SemiAdapt and SemiLoRA as
semi-supervised inference-efficient approaches that strengthen domain
adaptation and lead to improved overall performance in NMT. We demonstrate that
SemiAdapt can outperform full-domain fine-tuning, while most notably, SemiLoRA
can propel PEFT methods to match or even outperform full-model fine-tuning. We
further evaluate domain-by-dataset fine-tuning and demonstrate that our
embedding-based inference methods perform especially well on larger and noisier
corpora. All Irish translation models developed in this work are released as
open resources. These methods aim to make high-quality domain adaptation and
fine-tuning more accessible to researchers working with low-resource languages.

Abstract: Large Language Models demonstrate strong capabilities in single-turn
instruction following but suffer from Lost-in-Conversation (LiC), a degradation
in performance as information is revealed progressively in multi-turn settings.
Motivated by the current progress on Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR), we propose Curriculum Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Accuracy and Abstention Rewards (RLAAR), a framework that encourages models not
only to generate correct answers, but also to judge the solvability of
questions in the multi-turn conversation setting. Our approach employs a
competence-gated curriculum that incrementally increases dialogue difficulty
(in terms of instruction shards), stabilizing training while promoting
reliability. Using multi-turn, on-policy rollouts and a mixed-reward system,
RLAAR teaches models to balance problem-solving with informed abstention,
reducing premature answering behaviors that cause LiC. Evaluated on LiC
benchmarks, RLAAR significantly mitigates LiC performance decay (62.6% to
75.1%) and improves calibrated abstention rates (33.5% to 73.4%). Together,
these results provide a practical recipe for building multi-turn reliable and
trustworthy LLMs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Spatial functional organization is a hallmark of biological brains: neurons
are arranged topographically according to their response properties, at
multiple scales. In contrast, representations within most machine learning
models lack spatial biases, instead manifesting as disorganized vector spaces
that are difficult to visualize and interpret. Here, we propose a novel form of
self-attention that turns Transformers into "Topoformers" with topographic
organization. We introduce spatial querying - where keys and queries are
arranged on 2D grids, and local pools of queries are associated with a given
key - and spatial reweighting, where we convert the standard fully connected
layer of self-attention into a locally connected layer. We first demonstrate
the feasibility of our approach by training a 1-layer Topoformer on a sentiment
classification task. Training with spatial querying encourages topographic
organization in the queries and keys, and spatial reweighting separately
encourages topographic organization in the values and self-attention outputs.
We then apply the Topoformer motifs at scale, training a BERT architecture with
a masked language modeling objective. We find that the topographic variant
performs on par with a non-topographic control model on NLP benchmarks, yet
produces interpretable topographic organization as evaluated via eight
linguistic test suites. Finally, analyzing an fMRI dataset of human brain
responses to a large set of naturalistic sentences, we demonstrate alignment
between low-dimensional topographic variability in the Topoformer model and
human brain language network. Scaling up Topoformers further holds promise for
greater interpretability in NLP research, and for more accurate models of the
organization of linguistic information in the human brain.

large-scale dataset of 186K articles from online editions of 1.5K American
newspapers published in the summer of 2025. Using Pangram, a state-of-the-art
AI detector, we discover that approximately 9% of newly-published articles are
either partially or fully AI-generated. This AI use is unevenly distributed,
appearing more frequently in smaller, local outlets, in specific topics such as
weather and technology, and within certain ownership groups. We also analyze
45K opinion pieces from Washington Post, New York Times, and Wall Street
Journal, finding that they are 6.4 times more likely to contain AI-generated
content than news articles from the same publications, with many AI-flagged
op-eds authored by prominent public figures. Despite this prevalence, we find
that AI use is rarely disclosed: a manual audit of 100 AI-flagged articles
found only five disclosures of AI use. Overall, our audit highlights the
immediate need for greater transparency and updated editorial standards
regarding the use of AI in journalism to maintain public trust.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled progress in
agentic coding, where models autonomously reason, plan, and act within
interactive software development workflows. However, bridging the gap between
static text-based training and dynamic real-world agentic execution remains a
core challenge. In this technical report, we present KAT-Coder, a large-scale
agentic code model trained through a multi-stage curriculum encompassing
Mid-Term Training, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Reinforcement Fine-Tuning
(RFT), and Reinforcement-to-Deployment Adaptation. The Mid-Term stage enhances
reasoning, planning, and reflection capabilities through a corpus of real
software engineering data and synthetic agentic interactions. The SFT stage
constructs a million-sample dataset balancing twenty programming languages, ten
development contexts, and ten task archetypes. The RFT stage introduces a novel
multi-ground-truth reward formulation for stable and sample-efficient policy
optimization. Finally, the Reinforcement-to-Deployment phase adapts the model
to production-grade IDE environments using Error-Masked SFT and Tree-Structured
Trajectory Training. In summary, these stages enable KAT-Coder to achieve
robust tool-use reliability, instruction alignment, and long-context reasoning,
forming a deployable foundation for real-world intelligent coding agents. Our

Abstract: Search agents have achieved significant advancements in enabling intelligent
information retrieval and decision-making within interactive environments.
Although reinforcement learning has been employed to train agentic models
capable of more dynamic interactive retrieval, existing methods are limited by
shallow tool-use depth and the accumulation of errors over multiple iterative
interactions. In this paper, we present WebSeer, a more intelligent search
agent trained via reinforcement learning enhanced with a self-reflection
mechanism. Specifically, we construct a large dataset annotated with reflection
patterns and design a two-stage training framework that unifies cold start and
reinforcement learning within the self-reflection paradigm for real-world
web-based environments, which enables the model to generate longer and more
reflective tool-use trajectories. Our approach substantially extends tool-use
chains and improves answer accuracy. Using a single 14B model, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on HotpotQA and SimpleQA, with accuracies of 72.3% and
90.0%, respectively, and demonstrate strong generalization to

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) are becoming increasingly popular in specialized
fields, such as industrial applications, due to their efficiency, lower
computational requirements, and ability to be fine-tuned for domain-specific
tasks, enabling accurate and cost-effective solutions. However, performing
complex reasoning using SLMs in specialized fields such as Industry 4.0 remains
challenging. In this paper, we propose a knowledge distillation framework for
industrial asset health, which transfers reasoning capabilities via
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) distillation from Large Language Models (LLMs) to
smaller, more efficient models (SLMs). We discuss the advantages and the
process of distilling LLMs using multi-choice question answering (MCQA) prompts
to enhance reasoning and refine decision-making. We also perform in-context
learning to verify the quality of the generated knowledge and benchmark the
performance of fine-tuned SLMs with generated knowledge against widely used
LLMs. The results show that the fine-tuned SLMs with CoT reasoning outperform
the base models by a significant margin, narrowing the gap to their LLM
counterparts. Our code is open-sourced at:

Abstract: The adoption of long context windows has become a standard feature in Large
Language Models (LLMs), as extended contexts significantly enhance their
capacity for complex reasoning and broaden their applicability across diverse
scenarios. Dynamic sparse attention is a promising approach for reducing the
computational cost of long-context. However, efficiently training LLMs with
dynamic sparse attention on ultra-long contexts-especially in distributed
settings-remains a significant challenge, due in large part to worker- and
step-level imbalance. This paper introduces MTraining, a novel distributed
methodology leveraging dynamic sparse attention to enable efficient training
for LLMs with ultra-long contexts. Specifically, MTraining integrates three key
components: a dynamic sparse training pattern, balanced sparse ring attention,
and hierarchical sparse ring attention. These components are designed to
synergistically address the computational imbalance and communication overheads
inherent in dynamic sparse attention mechanisms during the training of models
with extensive context lengths. We demonstrate the efficacy of MTraining by
training Qwen2.5-3B, successfully expanding its context window from 32K to 512K
tokens on a cluster of 32 A100 GPUs. Our evaluations on a comprehensive suite
of downstream tasks, including RULER, PG-19, InfiniteBench, and Needle In A
Haystack, reveal that MTraining achieves up to a 6x higher training throughput
while preserving model accuracy. Our code is available at

Abstract: Faithfully personalizing large language models (LLMs) to align with
individual user preferences is a critical but challenging task. While
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) quickly reaches a performance plateau, standard
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) also struggles with the
nuances of personalization. Scalar-based reward models are prone to reward
hacking which leads to verbose and superficially personalized responses. To
address these limitations, we propose Critique-Post-Edit, a robust
reinforcement learning framework that enables more faithful and controllable
personalization. Our framework integrates two key components: (1) a
Personalized Generative Reward Model (GRM) that provides multi-dimensional
scores and textual critiques to resist reward hacking, and (2) a
Critique-Post-Edit mechanism where the policy model revises its own outputs
based on these critiques for more targeted and efficient learning. Under a
rigorous length-controlled evaluation, our method substantially outperforms
standard PPO on personalization benchmarks. Personalized Qwen2.5-7B achieves an
average 11\% win-rate improvement, and personalized Qwen2.5-14B model surpasses
the performance of GPT-4.1. These results demonstrate a practical path to
faithful, efficient, and controllable personalization.

Abstract: We present Ring-1T, the first open-source, state-of-the-art thinking model
with a trillion-scale parameter. It features 1 trillion total parameters and
activates approximately 50 billion per token. Training such models at a
trillion-parameter scale introduces unprecedented challenges, including
train-inference misalignment, inefficiencies in rollout processing, and
bottlenecks in the RL system. To address these, we pioneer three interconnected
innovations: (1) IcePop stabilizes RL training via token-level discrepancy
masking and clipping, resolving instability from training-inference mismatches;
(2) C3PO++ improves resource utilization for long rollouts under a token budget
by dynamically partitioning them, thereby obtaining high time efficiency; and
(3) ASystem, a high-performance RL framework designed to overcome the systemic
bottlenecks that impede trillion-parameter model training. Ring-1T delivers
breakthrough results across critical benchmarks: 93.4 on AIME-2025, 86.72 on
HMMT-2025, 2088 on CodeForces, and 55.94 on ARC-AGI-v1. Notably, it attains a
silver medal-level result on the IMO-2025, underscoring its exceptional
reasoning capabilities. By releasing the complete 1T parameter MoE model to the
community, we provide the research community with direct access to cutting-edge
reasoning capabilities. This contribution marks a significant milestone in
democratizing large-scale reasoning intelligence and establishes a new baseline
for open-source model performance.

Abstract: Despite their remarkable capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle
to effectively leverage historical interaction information in dynamic and
complex environments. Memory systems enable LLMs to move beyond stateless
interactions by introducing persistent information storage, retrieval, and
utilization mechanisms. However, existing memory systems often introduce
substantial time and computational overhead. To this end, we introduce a new
memory system called LightMem, which strikes a balance between the performance
and efficiency of memory systems. Inspired by the Atkinson-Shiffrin model of
human memory, LightMem organizes memory into three complementary stages. First,
cognition-inspired sensory memory rapidly filters irrelevant information
through lightweight compression and groups information according to their
topics. Next, topic-aware short-term memory consolidates these topic-based
groups, organizing and summarizing content for more structured access. Finally,
long-term memory with sleep-time update employs an offline procedure that
decouples consolidation from online inference. Experiments on LongMemEval with
GPT and Qwen backbones show that LightMem outperforms strong baselines in
accuracy (up to 10.9% gains) while reducing token usage by up to 117x, API
calls by up to 159x, and runtime by over 12x. The code is available at

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Growing evidence suggests that large language models do not use their depth
uniformly, yet we still lack a fine-grained understanding of their layer-wise
prediction dynamics. In this paper, we trace the intermediate representations
of several open-weight models during inference and reveal a structured and
nuanced use of depth. Specifically, we propose a "Guess-then-Refine" framework
that explains how LLMs internally structure their computations to make
predictions. We first show that the top-ranked predictions in early LLM layers
are composed primarily of high-frequency tokens, which act as statistical
guesses proposed by the model early on due to the lack of appropriate
contextual information. As contextual information develops deeper into the
model, these initial guesses get refined into contextually appropriate tokens.
Even high-frequency token predictions from early layers get refined >70% of the
time, indicating that correct token prediction is not "one-and-done". We then
go beyond frequency-based prediction to examine the dynamic usage of layer
depth across three case studies. (i) Part-of-speech analysis shows that
function words are, on average, the earliest to be predicted correctly. (ii)
Fact recall task analysis shows that, in a multi-token answer, the first token
requires more computational depth than the rest. (iii) Multiple-choice task
analysis shows that the model identifies the format of the response within the
first half of the layers, but finalizes its response only toward the end.
Together, our results provide a detailed view of depth usage in LLMs, shedding
light on the layer-by-layer computations that underlie successful predictions
and providing insights for future works to improve computational efficiency in
transformer-based models.

Abstract: Recommender-systems research has accelerated model and evaluation advances,
yet largely neglects automating the research process itself. We argue for a
shift from narrow AutoRecSys tools -- focused on algorithm selection and
hyper-parameter tuning -- to an Autonomous Recommender-Systems Research Lab
(AutoRecLab) that integrates end-to-end automation: problem ideation,
literature analysis, experimental design and execution, result interpretation,
manuscript drafting, and provenance logging. Drawing on recent progress in
automated science (e.g., multi-agent AI Scientist and AI Co-Scientist systems),
we outline an agenda for the RecSys community: (1) build open AutoRecLab
prototypes that combine LLM-driven ideation and reporting with automated
experimentation; (2) establish benchmarks and competitions that evaluate agents
on producing reproducible RecSys findings with minimal human input; (3) create
review venues for transparently AI-generated submissions; (4) define standards
for attribution and reproducibility via detailed research logs and metadata;
and (5) foster interdisciplinary dialogue on ethics, governance, privacy, and
fairness in autonomous research. Advancing this agenda can increase research
throughput, surface non-obvious insights, and position RecSys to contribute to
emerging Artificial Research Intelligence. We conclude with a call to organise
a community retreat to coordinate next steps and co-author guidance for the
responsible integration of automated research systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Scaling large recommendation systems requires advancing three major
frontiers: processing longer user histories, expanding candidate sets, and
increasing model capacity. While promising, transformers' computational cost
scales quadratically with the user sequence length and linearly with the number
of candidates. This trade-off makes it prohibitively expensive to expand
candidate sets or increase sequence length at inference, despite the
significant performance improvements.
  We introduce \textbf{LIME}, a novel architecture that resolves this
trade-off. Through two key innovations, LIME fundamentally reduces
computational complexity. First, low-rank ``link embeddings" enable
pre-computation of attention weights by decoupling user and candidate
interactions, making the inference cost nearly independent of candidate set
size. Second, a linear attention mechanism, \textbf{LIME-XOR}, reduces the
complexity with respect to user sequence length from quadratic ($O(N^2)$) to
linear ($O(N)$).
  Experiments on public and industrial datasets show LIME achieves near-parity
with state-of-the-art transformers but with a 10$\times$ inference speedup on
large candidate sets or long sequence lengths. When tested on a major
recommendation platform, LIME improved user engagement while maintaining
minimal inference costs with respect to candidate set size and user history
length, establishing a new paradigm for efficient and expressive recommendation
systems.

Abstract: The increasing number of data a booking platform such as Booking.com and
AirBnB offers make it challenging for interested parties to browse through the
available accommodations and analyze reviews in an efficient way. Efforts have
been made from the booking platform providers to utilize recommender systems in
an effort to enable the user to filter the results by factors such as stars,
amenities, cost but most valuable insights can be provided by the unstructured
text-based reviews. Going through these reviews one-by-one requires a
substantial amount of time to be devoted while a respectable percentage of the
reviews won't provide to the user what they are actually looking for.
  This research publication explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can
enhance short rental apartments recommendations by summarizing and mining key
insights from user reviews. The web application presented in this paper, named
"instaGuide", automates the procedure of isolating the text-based user reviews
from a property on the Booking.com platform, synthesizing the summary of the
reviews, and enabling the user to query specific aspects of the property in an
effort to gain feedback on their personal questions/criteria.
  During the development of the instaGuide tool, numerous LLM models were
evaluated based on accuracy, cost, and response quality. The results suggest
that the LLM-powered summarization reduces significantly the amount of time the
users need to devote on their search for the right short rental apartment,
improving the overall decision-making procedure.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to recommend mobile
applications through natural language prompts, offering a flexible alternative
to keyword-based app store search. Yet, the reasoning behind these
recommendations remains opaque, raising questions about their consistency,
explainability, and alignment with traditional App Store Optimization (ASO)
metrics. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of how widely-used
general purpose LLMs generate, justify, and rank mobile app recommendations.
Our contributions are: (i) a taxonomy of 16 generalizable ranking criteria
elicited from LLM outputs; (ii) a systematic evaluation framework to analyse
recommendation consistency and responsiveness to explicit ranking instructions;
and (iii) a replication package to support reproducibility and future research
on AI-based recommendation systems. Our findings reveal that LLMs rely on a
broad yet fragmented set of ranking criteria, only partially aligned with
standard ASO metrics. While top-ranked apps tend to be consistent across runs,
variability increases with ranking depth and search specificity. LLMs exhibit
varying sensitivity to explicit ranking instructions - ranging from substantial
adaptations to near-identical outputs - highlighting their complex reasoning
dynamics in conversational app discovery. Our results aim to support end-users,
app developers, and recommender-systems researchers in navigating the emerging
landscape of conversational app discovery.

Abstract: Product search is a crucial component of modern e-commerce platforms, with
billions of user queries every day. In product search systems, first-stage
retrieval should achieve high recall while ensuring efficient online
deployment. Sparse retrieval is particularly attractive in this context due to
its interpretability and storage efficiency. However, sparse retrieval methods
suffer from severe vocabulary mismatch issues, leading to suboptimal
performance in product search scenarios.With their potential for semantic
analysis, large language models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for mitigating
vocabulary mismatch issues and thereby improving retrieval quality. Directly
applying LLMs to sparse retrieval in product search exposes two key
challenges:(1)Queries and product titles are typically short and highly
susceptible to LLM-induced hallucinations, such as generating irrelevant
expansion terms or underweighting critical literal terms like brand names and
model numbers;(2)The large vocabulary space of LLMs leads to difficulty in
initializing training effectively, making it challenging to learn meaningful
sparse representations in such ultra-high-dimensional spaces.To address these
challenges, we propose PROSPER, a framework for PROduct search leveraging LLMs
as SParsE Retrievers. PROSPER incorporates: (1)A literal residual network that
alleviates hallucination in lexical expansion by reinforcing underweighted
literal terms through a residual compensation mechanism; and (2)A lexical
focusing window that facilitates effective training initialization via a
coarse-to-fine sparsification strategy.Extensive offline and online experiments
show that PROSPER significantly outperforms sparse baselines and achieves
recall performance comparable to advanced dense retrievers, while also
achieving revenue increments online.
