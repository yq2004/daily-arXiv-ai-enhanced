Our work addresses this gap by introducing\nStreetMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate models' approximation abilities\nunder real-world approximation scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations\nacross different LLM architectures: Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507,\nQwen3-4B-Thinking-2507, Dream-v0-Instruct-7B, Falcon-Mamba-7B-Instruct, and\nMamba-GPT-3B.
