However, most existing methods rely on static datasets and fixed models, limiting their ability to adapt to changes in user behavior over time. To address this limitation, we explore a novel task termed continual next POI recommendation, where models dynamically adapt to evolving user interests through continual updates. This task is particularly challenging, as it requires capturing shifting user behaviors while retaining previously learned knowledge. Moreover, it is essential to ensure efficiency in update time and memory usage for real-world deployment. To this end, we propose GIRAM (Generative Key-based Interest Retrieval and Adaptive Modeling), an efficient, model-agnostic framework that integrates context-aware sustained interests with recent interests. GIRAM comprises four components: (1) an interest memory to preserve historical preferences; (2) a context-aware key encoding module for unified interest key representation; (3) a generative key-based retrieval module to identify diverse and relevant sustained interests; and (4) an adaptive interest update and fusion module to update the interest memory and balance sustained and recent interests. In particular, GIRAM can be seamlessly integrated with existing next POI recommendation models. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that GIRAM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining high efficiency in both update time and memory consumption.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86GIRAM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5174\u8da3\u70b9\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5174\u8da3\u548c\u8fd1\u671f\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5174\u8da3\u70b9\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u6f14\u5316\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "GIRAM\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u5174\u8da3\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e93\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u952e\u7f16\u7801\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u952e\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5174\u8da3\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGIRAM\u5728\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u65b9\u9762\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "GIRAM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u6301\u7eed\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5174\u8da3\u70b9\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u6301\u7eed\u5174\u8da3\u548c\u8fd1\u671f\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u6f14\u5316\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

However, existing methods often treat CLIP as a static feature extractor, overlooking its adaptability to neural representations and the inherent physiological-symbolic gap in EEG-image alignment. To address these challenges, we present NeuroCLIP, a prompt tuning framework tailored for EEG-to-image contrastive learning. Our approach introduces three core innovations: (1) We design a dual-stream visual embedding pipeline that combines dynamic filtering and token-level fusion to generate instance-level adaptive prompts, which guide the adjustment of patch embedding tokens based on image content, thereby enabling fine-grained modulation of visual representations under neural constraints; (2) We are the first to introduce visual prompt tokens into EEG-image alignment, acting as global, modality- level prompts that work in conjunction with instance-level adjustments. These visual prompt tokens are inserted into the Transformer architecture to facilitate neural-aware adaptation and parameter optimization at a global level; (3) Inspired by neuroscientific principles of human visual encoding, we propose a refined contrastive loss that better model the semantic ambiguity and cross-modal noise present in EEG signals. On the THINGS-EEG2 dataset, NeuroCLIP achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 63.2% in zero-shot image retrieval, surpassing the previous best method by +12.3%, and demonstrates strong generalization under inter-subject conditions (+4.6% Top-1), highlighting the potential of physiology-aware prompt tuning for bridging brain signals and visual semantics.", "AI": {"tldr": "NeuroCLIP\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9EEG-\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u6ee4\u3001token\u7ea7\u878d\u5408\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793atoken\u7b49\u521b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8111\u7535\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5c06CLIP\u89c6\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4ee5\u53caEEG-\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u751f\u7406-\u7b26\u53f7\u9e3f\u6c9f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u6d41\u89c6\u89c9\u5d4c\u5165\u7ba1\u9053\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548ctoken\u7ea7\u878d\u5408\u751f\u6210\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u793a\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793atoken\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u6001\u7ea7\u63d0\u793a\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u539f\u7406\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728THINGS-EEG2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cNeuroCLIP\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523063.2%\u7684Top-1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u534712.3%\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "NeuroCLIP\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u751f\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u5728\u6865\u63a5\u8111\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u8111\u542f\u53d1\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

We propose Bi-RAR, a novel retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that evaluates each intermediate step jointly in both forward and backward directions. To assess the information completeness of each step, we introduce a bidirectional information distance grounded in Kolmogorov complexity, approximated via language model generation probabilities. This quantification measures both how far the current reasoning is from the answer and how well it addresses the question. To optimize reasoning under these bidirectional signals, we adopt a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework with a cascading reward structure that emphasizes early trajectory alignment.

As users exhibit diverse preferences, personalization has attracted increasing attention in LLM routing, since even identical queries may require different models to generate responses tailored to individual needs. However, existing approaches are not fully personalized and often fail to capture the complex interactions between specific users and LLMs. Moreover, user preference data is typically scarce, noisy, and inconsistent in format, which limits the effectiveness of methods that rely solely on user-specific data. To address these challenges, we propose GMTRouter, which represents multi-turn user-LLM interactions as a heterogeneous graph with four node types: user, LLM, query, and response, thereby preserving the rich relational structure of the interaction. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, GMTRouter learns to capture user preferences from few-shot data within a lightweight inductive graph learning framework, enabling effective personalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMTRouter consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.9 to 21.6 percent higher accuracy and 0.006 to 0.309 higher AUC across multiple datasets. More importantly, we demonstrate that GMTRouter can adapt to new users and evolving preferences using only few-shot data, without extensive fine-tuning.

These systems hold promise for advancing legal analysis and compliance monitoring in sensitive domains. However, this capability comes with a troubling contradiction: while LLMs can analyze and interpret laws, they also demonstrate alarming vulnerabilities in generating unsafe outputs, such as actionable steps for bioweapon creation, despite their safeguards. To address this challenge, we propose a methodology that integrates knowledge graph construction with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to systematically evaluate LLMs' understanding of this law, their capacity to assess legal intent (mens rea), and their potential for unsafe applications. Through structured experiments, we assess their accuracy in identifying legal violations, generating prohibited instructions, and detecting unlawful intent in bioweapons-related scenarios. Our findings reveal significant limitations in LLMs' reasoning and safety mechanisms, but they also point the way forward. By combining enhanced safety protocols with more robust legal reasoning frameworks, this research lays the groundwork for developing LLMs that can ethically and securely assist in sensitive legal domains - ensuring they act as protectors of the law rather than inadvertent enablers of its violation.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u5728\u5206\u6790\u751f\u7269\u6b66\u5668\u6cd5\u5f8b\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u77db\u76fe\uff1a\u65e2\u80fd\u89e3\u8bfb\u6cd5\u5f8b\uff0c\u53c8\u53ef\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u5371\u9669\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u548cRAG\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4f46\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684LLM\u6cd5\u5f8b\u52a9\u624b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5206\u6790\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u53d8\u9769\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u9690\u60a3\u2014\u2014\u5728\u89e3\u8bfb\u751f\u7269\u6b66\u5668\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u5371\u9669\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u77db\u76fe\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u6574\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210(RAG)\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5bf9\u751f\u7269\u6b66\u5668\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u610f\u56fe\u5224\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u4ee5\u53ca\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u5b89\u5168\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u80fd\u5b89\u5168\u534f\u52a9\u654f\u611f\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9886\u57df\u7684LLMs\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u6210\u4e3a\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u8005\u800c\u975e\u65e0\u610f\u4e2d\u7684\u8fdd\u53cd\u8005\u3002"}}

However, recent studies reveal that alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO significantly reduce the diversity of LLM outputs. Not only do aligned LLMs generate text with repetitive structure and word choice, they also approach problems in more uniform ways, and their responses reflect a narrower range of societal perspectives. We attribute this problem to the KL divergence regularizer employed in preference learning algorithms. This causes the model to systematically overweight majority opinions and sacrifice diversity in its outputs. To address this, we propose Soft Preference Learning, which decouples the entropy and cross-entropy terms in the KL penalty - allowing for fine-grained control over LLM generation diversity. From a capabilities perspective, LLMs trained using Soft Preference Learning attain higher accuracy on difficult repeated sampling tasks and produce outputs with greater semantic and lexical diversity. From an alignment perspective, they are capable of representing a wider range of societal viewpoints and display improved logit calibration.

We conducted experiments on GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B-instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B under Base, Zero-shot, and Few-shot conditions. The results showed up to 52% transformation success rate and up to 33% jailbreak success rate in the Zero-shot condition, and up to 65% transformation success rate and up to 41% jailbreak success rate in the Few-shot condition. By performing both prefix-based automated evaluation and human evaluation, we found that the automated evaluation consistently overestimated jailbreak success, with an average difference of 52%. This indicates that automated evaluation alone is not accurate for determining harmfulness. While this study is a toy-level study based on a limited query set and evaluators, it proves that our method can still be a valid attack scenario. These results suggest the need for a fundamental reconsideration of guardrail design and the establishment of a more robust evaluation methodology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSelf-HarmLLM\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u540c\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u6709\u5bb3\u67e5\u8be2\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u8f93\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f1a\u9ad8\u4f30\u8d8a\u72f1\u6210\u529f\u738752%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5047\u8bbe\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u6765\u81ea\u5916\u90e8\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u8f93\u51fa\u6210\u4e3a\u65b0\u653b\u51fb\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSelf-HarmLLM\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u540c\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684Mitigated Harmful Query\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u8f93\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u8d8a\u72f1\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5728GPT-3.5-turbo\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86Base\u3001Zero-shot\u548cFew-shot\u6761\u4ef6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "Zero-shot\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8f6c\u6362\u6210\u529f\u7387\u6700\u9ad852%\uff0c\u8d8a\u72f1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u6700\u9ad833%\uff1bFew-shot\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8f6c\u6362\u6210\u529f\u7387\u6700\u9ad865%\uff0c\u8d8a\u72f1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u6700\u9ad841%\u3002\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u6bd4\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e73\u5747\u9ad8\u4f3052%\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc1\u660e\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8003\u8651\u62a4\u680f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Focusing on the news domain where knowledge updates daily, OKBench is an agentic framework that automates the sourcing, creation, validation, and distribution of benchmarks. Our approach democratizes benchmark creation and facilitates thorough evaluation of retrieval-augmented methods by reducing overlap with pretraining data. We evaluate our framework on a wide range open-source and proprietary LLMs of various sizes and configurations, both with and without retrieval over freshly generated knowledge.

This study presents a proof-of-concept system integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with curated knowledge bases to generate pediatric SLP case materials. A multi-model RAG-based system was prototyped integrating curated domain knowledge with engineered prompt templates, supporting five commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) and open-source (Llama 3.2, Qwen 2.5-7B) LLMs. Seven test scenarios spanning diverse disorder types and grade levels were systematically designed. Generated cases underwent automated quality assessment using a multi-dimensional rubric evaluating structural completeness, internal consistency, clinical appropriateness, and IEP goal/session note quality. This proof-of-concept demonstrates technical feasibility for RAG-augmented generation of pediatric SLP vignettes. Commercial models showed marginal quality advantages, but open-source alternatives achieved acceptable performance, suggesting potential for privacy-preserving institutional deployment.

In this paper, we extend this approach to develop a similar framework for Bengali and apply it to translation tasks between English and Bengali. A central focus of our work lies in reassessing the effectiveness of DisCoCirc in reducing language bureaucracy. Unlike the result suggested in [5], our findings indicate that although it works well for a large part of the language, it still faces limitations due to the structural variation of the two languages.

However, SFT for domain specialization can be resource-intensive and sometimes leads to a deterioration in performance over general capabilities due to catastrophic forgetting (CF). To address these issues, we propose a self-adaptive gradient-aware data selection approach (GrADS) for supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, which identifies effective subsets of training data by analyzing gradients obtained from a preliminary training phase. Specifically, we design self-guided criteria that leverage the magnitude and statistical distribution of gradients to prioritize examples that contribute the most to the model's learning process. This approach enables the acquisition of representative samples that enhance LLMs understanding of domain-specific tasks. Through extensive experimentation with various LLMs across diverse domains such as medicine, law, and finance, GrADS has demonstrated significant efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

Also, we apply Explainable AI methods using SHapley Additive exPlanations to interpret the prediction results and verifying the model reliability. This integration of CNN local feature extraction, BiGRU bidirectional sequence modeling, attention mechanisms, and SHAP interpretability provides a comprehensive framework for suicide detection.

However, extracting such information from unstructured patient narratives is challenging due to the subtle, overlapping nature of cognitive constructs. This study developed and evaluated natural language processing (NLP) models to automatically identify categories that reflect various cognitive processes from de-identified first-person narratives. Three model families, a Bio_ClinicalBERT-based span categorization model for nested entity recognition, a fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct model using QLoRA for instruction following, and GPT-4o mini evaluated under zero- and few-shot settings, were compared on their performance on extracting seven categories. Our findings indicated that model performance varied substantially across categories and model families. The fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct achieved the highest overall F1-scores (0.74 micro-average and 0.59 macro-average), particularly excelling in context-dependent categories such as thought and social interaction. Bio_ClinicalBERT exhibited high precision but low recall and performed comparable to Llama for some category types such as location and time but failed on other categories such as thought, emotion and social interaction. Compared to conventional information extraction tasks, this task presents a greater challenge due to the abstract and overlapping nature of narrative accounts of complex cognitive processes.

Yet, real-world conversations naturally involve fluid transitions between these modes. To address this gap, we introduce TACT (TOD-And-Chitchat Transition), a dataset designed for transition-aware dialogue modeling that incorporates structurally diverse and integrated mode flows. TACT supports both user- and agent-driven mode switches, enabling robust modeling of complex conversational dynamics. To evaluate an agent's ability to initiate and recover from mode transitions, we propose two new metrics -- Switch and Recovery. Models trained on TACT outperform baselines in both intent detection and mode transition handling. Moreover, applying Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to TACT-trained models yields additional gains, achieving 75.74\\% joint mode-intent accuracy and a 70.1\\% win rate against GPT-4o in human evaluation.

Despite progress, current approaches typically depend on single data types or predefined extraction patterns, which restricts the discovery of novel and complex connections. Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents show significant potential, with capabilities in information retrieval, reasoning, and generation. However, their application to biomedical hypothesis generation has been limited by the absence of standardized datasets and execution environments. To address this, we introduce BioVerge, a comprehensive benchmark, and BioVerge Agent, an LLM-based agent framework, to create a standardized environment for exploring biomedical hypothesis generation at the frontier of existing scientific knowledge. Our dataset includes structured and textual data derived from historical biomedical hypotheses and PubMed literature, organized to support exploration by LLM agents. BioVerge Agent utilizes a ReAct-based approach with distinct Generation and Evaluation modules that iteratively produce and self-assess hypothesis proposals. Through extensive experimentation, we uncover key insights: 1) different architectures of BioVerge Agent influence exploration diversity and reasoning strategies; 2) structured and textual information sources each provide unique, critical contexts that enhance hypothesis generation; and 3) self-evaluation significantly improves the novelty and relevance of proposed hypotheses.", "AI": {"tldr": "BioVerge\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u5047\u8bbe\u751f\u6210\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548cLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528ReAct\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5236\u6765\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u9896\u4e14\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u5047\u8bbe\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u6216\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u63d0\u53d6\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u9896\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6267\u884c\u73af\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBioVerge\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548cBioVerge Agent\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528ReAct\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u5047\u8bbe\u63d0\u6848\u3002\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u542b\u5386\u53f2\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u5047\u8bbe\u548cPubMed\u6587\u732e\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09\u4e0d\u540cBioVerge Agent\u67b6\u6784\u5f71\u54cd\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff1b2\uff09\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u6e90\u5404\u81ea\u63d0\u4f9b\u72ec\u7279\u5173\u952e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff1b3\uff09\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "BioVerge\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u5047\u8bbe\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u63d0\u9ad8\u5047\u8bbe\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

The Two Sides of Probabilistic Learning in Large Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they have also been used to assist in citation recommendation, the hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce bibliographic records depends on whether the underlying knowledge is generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear in the pretraining corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency with which a given bibliographic record appears in the pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified 100 citations across twenty computer-science domains, and measured factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic metadata. The results revealed that (i) citation count is strongly correlated with factual accuracy, (ii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatim memorized beyond roughly 1,000 citations, and (iii) memory interference occurs when multiple highly cited papers share similar content. These findings indicate a threshold where generalization shifts into memorization, with highly cited papers being nearly verbatim retained in the model.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u5728\u751f\u6210\u53c2\u8003\u6587\u732e\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5f15\u7528\u6b21\u6570\u4e0e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc71000\u6b21\u5f15\u7528\u7684\u8bba\u6587\u51e0\u4e4e\u88ab\u9010\u5b57\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5f15\u7528\u8bba\u6587\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u5728\u53c2\u8003\u6587\u732e\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5047\u8bbeLLMs\u6b63\u786e\u751f\u6210\u53c2\u8003\u6587\u732e\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u662f\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8fd8\u662f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\uff0c\u9ad8\u5f15\u7528\u8bba\u6587\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u9891\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528GPT-4.1\u572820\u4e2a\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u751f\u6210100\u6761\u53c2\u8003\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u624b\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5143\u6570\u636e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u6765\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff1a(i)\u5f15\u7528\u6b21\u6570\u4e0e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\uff1b(ii)\u8d85\u8fc7\u7ea61000\u6b21\u5f15\u7528\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u6587\u732e\u4fe1\u606f\u51e0\u4e4e\u88ab\u9010\u5b57\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff1b(iii)\u5f53\u591a\u4e2a\u9ad8\u5f15\u7528\u8bba\u6587\u5185\u5bb9\u76f8\u4f3c\u65f6\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u6cdb\u5316\u8f6c\u5411\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5f15\u7528\u7684\u8bba\u6587\u51e0\u4e4e\u88ab\u9010\u5b57\u4fdd\u7559\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3LLMs\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u673a\u5236\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

This raises a fundamental question: can we achieve a synergy with high throughput, higher GPU utilization, and AR level quality? Existing methods fail to effectively balance these two aspects, either prioritizing AR using a weaker model for sequential drafting (speculative decoding), leading to lower drafting efficiency, or using some form of left-to-right (AR-like) decoding logic for diffusion, which still suffers from quality degradation and forfeits its potential parallelizability. We introduce TiDAR, a sequence-level hybrid architecture that drafts tokens (Thinking) in Diffusion and samples final outputs (Talking) AutoRegressively - all within a single forward pass using specially designed structured attention masks. This design exploits the free GPU compute density, achieving a strong balance between drafting and verification capacity. Moreover, TiDAR is designed to be serving-friendly (low overhead) as a standalone model. We extensively evaluate TiDAR against AR models, speculative decoding, and diffusion variants across generative and likelihood tasks at 1.5B and 8B scales. Thanks to the parallel drafting and sampling as well as exact KV cache support, TiDAR outperforms speculative decoding in measured throughput and surpasses diffusion models like Dream and Llada in both efficiency and quality.

In tasks like natural language inference (NLI), human label variation (HLV) arises when multiple labels are valid for the same instance, making it difficult to separate annotation errors from plausible variation. An earlier framework VARIERR (Weber-Genzel et al., 2024) asks multiple annotators to explain their label decisions in the first round and flag errors via validity judgments in the second round. However, conducting two rounds of manual annotation is costly and may limit the coverage of plausible labels or explanations. Our study proposes a new framework, EVADE, for generating and validating explanations to detect errors using large language models (LLMs). We perform a comprehensive analysis comparing human- and LLM-detected errors for NLI across distribution comparison, validation overlap, and impact on model fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM validation refines generated explanation distributions to more closely align with human annotations, and that removing LLM-detected errors from training data yields improvements in fine-tuning performance than removing errors identified by human annotators. This highlights the potential to scale error detection, reducing human effort while improving dataset quality under label variation.", "AI": {"tldr": "EVADE\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u89e3\u91ca\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u53d8\u5f02\u73b0\u8c61\u4f7f\u5f97\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u6807\u6ce8\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u5408\u7406\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u4f20\u7edfVARIERR\u6846\u67b6\u9700\u8981\u4e24\u8f6e\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u9650\u5236\u5408\u7406\u6807\u7b7e\u6216\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEVADE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u89e3\u91ca\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cLLM\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5206\u5e03\u6bd4\u8f83\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u91cd\u53e0\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "LLM\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u591f\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u3002\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u79fb\u9664LLM\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6bd4\u79fb\u9664\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u66f4\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5fae\u8c03\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "EVADE\u6846\u67b6\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u53d8\u5f02\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6269\u5c55\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

A progressive alignment objective combined with structured annotations maintains coherence between latent and textual reasoning. Across mathematical, logical, and commonsense reasoning tasks, SpiralThinker achieves the best overall performance among latent reasoning approaches, consistently surpassing previous methods across all benchmarks.

To overcome this limitation, we shift from snapshot-based evaluation to trajectory-based assessment, adopting a user-centered perspective that evaluates models based on their ability to improve and stabilize user emotional states over time. Our framework constructs a large-scale benchmark consisting of 328 emotional contexts and 1,152 disturbance events, simulating realistic emotional shifts under evolving dialogue scenarios. To encourage psychologically grounded responses, we constrain model outputs using validated emotion regulation strategies such as situation selection and cognitive reappraisal. User emotional trajectories are modeled as a first-order Markov process, and we apply causally-adjusted emotion estimation to obtain unbiased emotional state tracking. Based on this framework, we introduce three trajectory-level metrics: Baseline Emotional Level (BEL), Emotional Trajectory Volatility (ETV), and Emotional Centroid Position (ECP).

To address this limitation, we present a two-stage neurosymbolic framework that (1) uses LLMs with optional human guidance to formalize natural language policies, allowing fine-grained control of the formalization process, and (2) uses inference-time autoformalization to validate logical correctness of natural language statements against those policies. When correctness is paramount, we perform multiple redundant formalization steps at inference time, cross checking the formalizations for semantic equivalence. Our benchmarks demonstrate that our approach exceeds 99% soundness, indicating a near-zero false positive rate in identifying logical validity.

Covering 8 main task types and over 500 tasks, MM-CRITIC collects responses from various LMMs with different model sizes and is composed of 4471 samples. To enhance the evaluation reliability, we integrate expert-informed ground answers into scoring rubrics that guide GPT-4o in annotating responses and generating reference critiques, which serve as anchors for trustworthy judgments. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of MM-CRITIC and provide a comprehensive assessment of leading LMMs' critique capabilities under multiple dimensions.

While previous studies have benchmarked the humor capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), they have often relied on single-dimensional evaluations, such as judging whether something is simply ``funny.'' This paper argues that a multifaceted understanding of humor is necessary and addresses this gap by systematically evaluating LLMs through the lens of Oogiri, a form of Japanese improvisational comedy games. To achieve this, we expanded upon existing Oogiri datasets with data from new sources and then augmented the collection with Oogiri responses generated by LLMs. We then manually annotated this expanded collection with 5-point absolute ratings across six dimensions: Novelty, Clarity, Relevance, Intelligence, Empathy, and Overall Funniness. Using this dataset, we assessed the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs on two core tasks: their ability to generate creative Oogiri responses and their ability to evaluate the funniness of responses using a six-dimensional evaluation. Our results show that while LLMs can generate responses at a level between low- and mid-tier human performance, they exhibit a notable lack of Empathy.

We reinterpret the attention map with positional encoding as a noisy feature map, and propose Denoising Positional Encoding (DoPE), a training-free method based on truncated matrix entropy to detect outlier frequency bands in the feature map. Leveraging the noise characteristics of the feature map, we further reparameterize it with a parameter-free Gaussian distribution to achieve robust extrapolation. Our method theoretically reveals the underlying cause of the attention sink phenomenon and its connection to truncated matrix entropy. Experiments on needle-in-a-haystack and many-shot in-context learning tasks demonstrate that DoPE significantly improves retrieval accuracy and reasoning stability across extended contexts (up to 64K tokens). The results show that the denoising strategy for positional embeddings effectively mitigates attention sinks and restores balanced attention patterns, providing a simple yet powerful solution for improving length generalization.

However, tool learning is hampered by the static synthetic data pipelines where data generation and model training are executed as two separate, non-interactive processes. This approach fails to adaptively focus on a model's specific weaknesses and allows noisy labels to persist, degrading training efficiency. We introduce LoopTool, a fully automated, model-aware data evolution framework that closes this loop by tightly integrating data synthesis and model training. LoopTool iteratively refines both the data and the model through three synergistic modules: (1) Greedy Capability Probing (GCP) diagnoses the model's mastered and failed capabilities; (2) Judgement-Guided Label Verification (JGLV) uses an open-source judge model to find and correct annotation errors, progressively purifying the dataset; and (3) Error-Driven Data Expansion (EDDE) generates new, challenging samples based on identified failures. This closed-loop process operates within a cost-effective, open-source ecosystem, eliminating dependence on expensive closed-source APIs.

However, directly entering entire tables as long text into LLMs often leads to incorrect answers because most LLMs cannot inherently capture complex table structures. In this paper, we propose a cell extraction method for TQA without manual identification, even for complex table headers. Our approach estimates table headers by computing similarities between a given question and individual cells via a hybrid retrieval mechanism that integrates a language model and TF-IDF. We then select as the answer the cells at the intersection of the most relevant row and column. Furthermore, the language model is trained using contrastive learning on a small dataset of question-header pairs to enhance performance. We evaluated our approach in the TQA dataset from the U4 shared task at NTCIR-18. The experimental results show that our pipeline achieves an accuracy of 74.6\\%, outperforming existing LLMs such as GPT-4o mini~(63.9\\%).

A recent critique argued that the original results were confounded by how topics were selected for the topic-based component, and noted that the metric had not been validated against ground-truth measures of flow. That work proposed using only the contextual term as a more conceptually valid and interpretable alternative. In this paper, we empirically validate that proposal. Using two essay datasets with human-annotated trait scores, ASAP++ and ELLIPSE, we show that the contextual version of sequentiality aligns more closely with human assessments of discourse-level traits such as Organization and Cohesion. While zero-shot prompted LLMs predict trait scores more accurately than the contextual measure alone, the contextual measure adds more predictive value than both the topic-only and original sequentiality formulations when combined with standard linguistic features. Notably, this combination also outperforms the zero-shot LLM predictions, highlighting the value of explicitly modeling sentence-to-sentence flow.

Alternatively, it can be learned during training to optimise the training objective. In this paper we study the learning dynamics of subword segmentation: if a language model can dynamically optimise tokenisation, how do its subwords evolve during pretraining and finetuning? To explore this, we extend the subword segmental language model (SSLM), a framework for learning subwords during training, to support pretraining and finetuning. We train models for three typologically diverse languages to study learning dynamics across the morphological spectrum: Isi-Xhosa is conjunctive (long word forms composed of many morphemes), Setswana is disjunctive (morphemes written as separate words), and English represents a typological middle ground. We analyse subword dynamics from a linguistic perspective, tracking morphology, productivity, and fertility. We identify four stages of subword learning, with the morphologically complex isi-Xhosa exhibiting greater instability. During finetuning, subword boundaries shift to become finer-grained. Lastly, we show that learnable subwords offers a promising approach to improve text generation and cross-lingual transfer for low-resource, morphologically complex languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5b50\u8bcd\u5206\u5272\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b50\u8bcd\u4f1a\u7ecf\u5386\u56db\u4e2a\u5b66\u4e60\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5f62\u6001\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u66f4\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\u5b50\u8bcd\u8fb9\u754c\u4f1a\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5b50\u8bcd\u5206\u5272\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u9884\u5904\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u56fa\u5b9a\uff0c\u4f46\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u5b50\u8bcd\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u4ee5\u7814\u7a76\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u8bcd\u53ca\u5176\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55\u5b50\u8bcd\u5206\u6bb5\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(SSLM)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4e09\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u5b66\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8bed\u8a00(isi-Xhosa\u3001Setswana\u3001\u82f1\u8bed)\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ece\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u5b50\u8bcd\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5b50\u8bcd\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5f62\u6001\u590d\u6742\u7684isi-Xhosa\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\u5b50\u8bcd\u8fb9\u754c\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\uff1b\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u5b50\u8bcd\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u5f62\u6001\u590d\u6742\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u5b50\u8bcd\u5206\u5272\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u3001\u5f62\u6001\u590d\u6742\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b50\u8bcd\u5b66\u4e60\u5177\u6709\u660e\u786e\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u4f1a\u4fc3\u4f7f\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u3002"}}

However, most existing methods optimize only for final task outcomes, leaving models vulnerable to collapse when negative rewards dominate early training. This challenge is especially pronounced in honesty alignment, where models must not only solve answerable queries but also identify when conclusions cannot be drawn from the given premises. Deductive reasoning provides an ideal testbed because it isolates reasoning capability from reliance on external factual knowledge. To investigate honesty alignment, we curate two multi-step deductive reasoning datasets from graph structures, one for linear algebra and one for logical inference, and introduce unanswerable cases by randomly perturbing an edge in half of the instances. We find that GRPO, with or without supervised fine tuning initialization, struggles on these tasks. Through extensive experiments across three models, we evaluate stabilization strategies and show that curriculum learning provides some benefit but requires carefully designed in distribution datasets with controllable difficulty. To address these limitations, we propose Anchor, a reinforcement learning method that injects ground truth trajectories into rollouts, preventing early training collapse. Our results demonstrate that this method stabilizes learning and significantly improves the overall reasoning performance, underscoring the importance of training dynamics for enabling reliable deductive reasoning in aligned language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAnchor\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u771f\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\u6ce8\u5165\u5230\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8bda\u5b9e\u5bf9\u9f50\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u65e9\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f14\u7ece\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60(RLVR)\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f18\u5316\u6700\u7ec8\u4efb\u52a1\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5f53\u65e9\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8d1f\u5956\u52b1\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\u65f6\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u6613\u5d29\u6e83\u3002\u8fd9\u5728\u8bda\u5b9e\u5bf9\u9f50\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u53ef\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u8fd8\u8981\u8bc6\u522b\u4f55\u65f6\u65e0\u6cd5\u4ece\u7ed9\u5b9a\u524d\u63d0\u5f97\u51fa\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "method": "1) \u4ece\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7b56\u5212\u4e24\u4e2a\u591a\u6b65\u6f14\u7ece\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u7ebf\u6027\u4ee3\u6570\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\uff09\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u6270\u52a8\u8fb9\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u53ef\u56de\u7b54\u6848\u4f8b\uff1b3) \u63d0\u51faAnchor\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728rollout\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u771f\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u65e9\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1aGRPO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u65e0\u8bba\u6709\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff09\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1b\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u5e2e\u52a9\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1bAnchor\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6574\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5728\u5df2\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6f14\u7ece\u63a8\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0cAnchor\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u5165\u771f\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u65e9\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bda\u5b9e\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches often overlook semantic commonalities across source languages, leading to biased translation performance. In this work, we propose \\textbf{POTSA} (Parallel Optimal Transport for Speech Alignment), a new framework based on cross-lingual parallel speech pairs and Optimal Transport (OT), designed to bridge high- and low-resource translation gaps. First, we introduce a Bias Compensation module to coarsely align initial speech representations across languages. Second, we impose token-level OT constraints on a Q-Former using parallel speech pairs to establish fine-grained consistency of representations. Then, we apply a layer scheduling strategy to focus OT constraints on the most semantically beneficial layers.

However, controlling specific attributes of generated text remains challenging without architectural modifications or extensive fine-tuning. Current methods typically toggle a single, basic attribute but struggle with precise multi-attribute control. In scenarios where attribute requirements conflict, existing methods lack coordination mechanisms, causing interference between desired attributes. Furthermore, these methods fail to incorporate iterative optimization processes in the controlled generation pipeline. To address these limitations, we propose Conflict-aware, Composite, and Collaborative Controlled Text Generation (C$^3$TG), a two-phase framework for fine-grained, multi-dimensional text attribute control. During generation, C$^3$TG selectively pairs the LLM with the required attribute classifiers from the 17 available dimensions and employs weighted KL-divergence to adjust token probabilities. The optimization phase then leverages an energy function combining classifier scores and penalty terms to resolve attribute conflicts through iterative feedback, enabling precise control over multiple dimensions simultaneously while preserving natural text flow. Experiments show that C$^3$TG significantly outperforms baselines across multiple metrics including attribute accuracy, linguistic fluency, and output diversity, while simultaneously reducing toxicity. These results establish C$^3$TG as an effective and flexible solution for multi-dimensional text attribute control that requires no costly model modifications.", "AI": {"tldr": "C\u00b3TG\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u914d\u5bf9LLM\u4e0e\u5c5e\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u52a0\u6743KL\u6563\u5ea6\u8c03\u6574token\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u80fd\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6587\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u591a\u5c5e\u6027\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\u51b2\u7a81\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u534f\u8c03\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u878d\u5165\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faC\u00b3TG\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u751f\u6210\u9636\u6bb5\u9009\u62e9\u6240\u9700\u5c5e\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u52a0\u6743KL\u6563\u5ea6\u8c03\u6574token\u6982\u7387\uff1b\u4f18\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\u5229\u7528\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5206\u6570\u548c\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u53cd\u9988\u89e3\u51b3\u5c5e\u6027\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "result": "C\u00b3TG\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5c5e\u6027\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u6bd2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "C\u00b3TG\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u6a21\u578b\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u6587\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Specifically, we utilize the rapid System 1 to compute the answer entropy for given queries. This score is then used to evaluate the potential of samples for scaling, enabling dynamic self-consistency under System 2. Benefiting from the advance and accurate estimation provided by System 1, the proposed method can reduce token usage while simultaneously achieving a significant decrease in latency through parallel generation.

However, it remains uncertain whether this capability extends beyond task-specific evaluations to more general assessments of text quality, particularly in multilingual contexts. In this study, we introduce, MTQ-Eval, a novel framework for multilingual text quality evaluation that learns from examples of both high- and low-quality texts, adjusting its internal representations.

However, their effectiveness is critically dependent on ranking accuracy, a metric where further gains are highly impactful. This limitation arises from a fundamental problem that we identify and formalize as the Overfitting-Underfitting Dilemma: current margin designs cause models to apply excessive, wasteful gradients to correctly ranked samples (overfitting) while providing insufficient corrective signals for misranked ones (underfitting). To resolve this dilemma, we propose Adaptive Margin-attached Preference Optimization (AMaPO), a simple yet principled algorithm. AMaPO employs an instance-wise adaptive margin, refined by Z-normalization and exponential scaling, which dynamically reallocates learning effort by amplifying gradients for misranked samples and suppressing them for correct ones. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that AMaPO not only achieves better ranking accuracy and superior downstream alignment performance, but targeted analysis also confirms that it successfully mitigates the core overfitting and underfitting issues.", "AI": {"tldr": "AMaPO\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fb9\u8ddd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u79bb\u7ebf\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408-\u6b20\u62df\u5408\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u6392\u5e8f\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u79bb\u7ebf\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u62df\u5408-\u6b20\u62df\u5408\u56f0\u5883\uff1a\u5bf9\u6b63\u786e\u6392\u5e8f\u6837\u672c\u65bd\u52a0\u8fc7\u591a\u68af\u5ea6\u6d6a\u8d39\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u9519\u8bef\u6392\u5e8f\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6392\u5e8f\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fb9\u8ddd\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316(AMaPO)\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fb9\u8ddd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Z\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u548c\u6307\u6570\u7f29\u653e\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5b66\u4e60\u529b\u5ea6\uff1a\u653e\u5927\u9519\u8bef\u6392\u5e8f\u6837\u672c\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u6b63\u786e\u6392\u5e8f\u6837\u672c\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cAMaPO\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u6b20\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "AMaPO\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fb9\u8ddd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u79bb\u7ebf\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Consequently, there is a need for a robust and unified benchmark to assess the counseling competence of various LLMs. Existing works, however, are limited by unprofessional client simulation, static question-and-answer evaluation formats, and unidimensional metrics. These limitations hinder their effectiveness in assessing a model's comprehensive ability to handle diverse and complex clients. To address this gap, we introduce \\textbf{CARE-Bench}, a dynamic and interactive automated benchmark. It is built upon diverse client profiles derived from real-world counseling cases and simulated according to expert guidelines. CARE-Bench provides a multidimensional performance evaluation grounded in established psychological scales. Using CARE-Bench, we evaluate several general-purpose LLMs and specialized counseling models, revealing their current limitations. In collaboration with psychologists, we conduct a detailed analysis of the reasons for LLMs' failures when interacting with clients of different types, which provides directions for developing more comprehensive, universal, and effective counseling models.", "AI": {"tldr": "CARE-Bench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u54a8\u8be2\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u683c\u5f0f\u548c\u6307\u6807\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fc3\u7406\u54a8\u8be2\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u957f\u4e0e\u6709\u9650\u670d\u52a1\u4f9b\u7ed9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u4fc3\u4f7f\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8be5\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7a33\u5065\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5404\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u54a8\u8be2\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u5b58\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u6a21\u62df\u4e0d\u4e13\u4e1a\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u683c\u5f0f\u9759\u6001\u95ee\u7b54\u3001\u6307\u6807\u5355\u4e00\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u5fc3\u7406\u54a8\u8be2\u6848\u4f8b\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5ba2\u6237\u6863\u6848\uff0c\u6309\u7167\u4e13\u5bb6\u6307\u5bfc\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5CARE-Bench\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u719f\u5fc3\u7406\u91cf\u8868\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u54a8\u8be2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u4e0e\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\u5408\u4f5c\u8be6\u7ec6\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u5ba2\u6237\u4e92\u52a8\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "conclusion": "CARE-Bench\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u3001\u901a\u7528\u548c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u54a8\u8be2\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u8d25\u539f\u56e0\u6307\u5bfc\u672a\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

Information Extraction (IE) from scientific publications enables to identify information about research concepts and resources on a large scale and therefore is a pathway to improve understanding and reproducibility of ML-related research. To extract and connect fine-grained information in ML-related research, e.g. method training and data usage, we introduce GSAP-ERE. It is a manually curated fine-grained dataset with 10 entity types and 18 semantically categorized relation types, containing mentions of 63K entities and 35K relations from the full text of 100 ML publications. We show that our dataset enables fine-tuned models to automatically extract information relevant for downstream tasks ranging from knowledge graph (KG) construction, to monitoring the computational reproducibility of AI research at scale. Additionally, we use our dataset as a test suite to explore prompting strategies for IE using Large Language Models (LLM). We observe that the performance of state-of-the-art LLM prompting methods is largely outperformed by our best fine-tuned baseline model (NER: 80.6%, RE: 54.0% for the fine-tuned model vs. NER: 44.4%, RE: 10.1% for the LLM).
