Leveraging auxiliary behaviors (e.g., clicks, likes, shares) is\ntherefore essential. Recent progress on generative recommendations has brought\nnew possibilities for multi-behavior sequential recommendation. However,\nexisting generative approaches face two significant challenges: 1) Inadequate\nSequence Modeling: capture the complex, cross-level dependencies within user\nbehavior sequences, and 2) Lack of Suitable Datasets: publicly available\nmulti-behavior recommendation datasets are almost exclusively derived from\ne-commerce platforms, limiting the validation of feasibility in other domains,\nwhile also lacking sufficient side information for semantic ID generation. To\naddress these issues, we propose a novel generative framework, GAMER\n(Generative Augmentation and Multi-lEvel behavior modeling for Recommendation),\nbuilt upon a decoder-only backbone. GAMER introduces a cross-level interaction\nlayer to capture hierarchical dependencies among behaviors and a sequential\naugmentation strategy that enhances robustness in training. To further advance\nthis direction, we collect and release ShortVideoAD, a large-scale\nmulti-behavior dataset from a mainstream short-video platform, which differs\nfundamentally from existing e-commerce datasets and provides pretrained\nsemantic IDs for research on generative methods.

To address these limitations, we propose\nOMRC-MR, a hierarchical framework that integrates QA-style OMRC (Objective,\nMethod, Result, Conclusion) summarization, multi-level contrastive learning,\nand structure-aware re-ranking for scholarly recommendation. The QA-style\nsummarization module converts raw papers into structured and\ndiscourse-consistent representations, while multi-level contrastive objectives\nalign semantic representations across metadata, section, and document levels.\nThe final re-ranking stage further refines retrieval precision through\ncontextual similarity calibration.

Without such realistic\nscenes, training embodied agents in unrealistic environments can lead them to\nlearn priors that diverge significantly from real-world physics and semantics,\ndegrading their performance when deployed. Thus, verifying the alignment\nbetween the fine-grained instruction and the generated scene is essential for\neffective learning.

Existing research using contrastive, meta-learning, or data\naugmentation suffers from generalizability issues or lack of coherence between\ntext and target. Recent works leveraging large language models (LLMs) for ZSSD\nfocus either on improving unseen target-specific knowledge or generating\nexplanations for stance analysis. However, most of these works are limited by\ntheir over-reliance on explicit reasoning, provide coarse explanations that\nlack nuance, and do not explicitly model the reasoning process, making it\ndifficult to interpret the model's predictions. To address these issues, in our\nstudy, we develop a novel interpretable ZSSD framework, IRIS. We provide an\ninterpretable understanding of the attitude of the input towards the target\nimplicitly based on sequences within the text (implicit rationales) and\nexplicitly based on linguistic measures (explicit rationales). IRIS considers\nstance detection as an information retrieval ranking task, understanding the\nrelevance of implicit rationales for different stances to guide the model\ntowards correct predictions without requiring the ground-truth of rationales,\nthus providing inherent interpretability. In addition, explicit rationales\nbased on communicative features help decode the emotional and cognitive\ndimensions of stance, offering an interpretable understanding of the author's\nattitude towards the given target. Extensive experiments on the benchmark\ndatasets of VAST, EZ-STANCE, P-Stance, and RFD using 50%, 30%, and even 10%\ntraining data prove the generalizability of our model, benefiting from the\nproposed architecture and interpretable design."}
