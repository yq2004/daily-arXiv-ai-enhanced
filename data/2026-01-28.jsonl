As application contexts become more diverse and complex, there is a growing need for more sophisticated recommendation techniques. One example is the composite item (for example, fashion outfit) recommendation where multiple levels of user preference information might be available and relevant. In this study, we propose JIMA, a joint interaction modeling approach that uses a single model to take advantage of all data from different levels of granularity and incorporate interactions to learn the complex relationships among lower-order (atomic item) and higher-order (composite item) user preferences as well as domain expertise (e.g., on the stylistic fit). We comprehensively evaluate the proposed method and compare it with advanced baselines through multiple simulation studies as well as with real data in both offline and online settings. The results consistently demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach."}

In real-world web platforms, interaction histories are inherently noisy due to accidental clicks, temporal inconsistencies, missing values, and evolving preferences, raising concerns about explanation stability and user trust. We present RobustExplain, the first systematic evaluation framework for measuring the robustness of LLM-generated recommendation explanations. RobustExplain introduces five realistic user behavior perturbations evaluated across multiple severity levels and a multi-dimensional robustness metric capturing semantic, keyword, structural, and length consistency. Our goal is to establish a principled, task-level evaluation framework and initial robustness baselines, rather than to provide a comprehensive leaderboard across all available LLMs. Experiments on four representative LLMs (7B--70B) show that current models exhibit only moderate robustness, with larger models achieving up to 8% higher stability. Our results establish the first robustness benchmarks for explanation agents and highlight robustness as a critical dimension for trustworthy, agent-driven recommender systems at web scale."}

For example, an e-commerce platform may require every recommendation list to include items from multiple sellers and at least one newly listed product; violating such constraints--even once--is unacceptable in production. Prior work on multi-objective recommendation and recent LLM-based recommender agents largely treat constraints as soft penalties or focus on item scoring and interaction, leading to frequent violations in real-world deployments. How to leverage LLMs for coordinating constrained optimization in recommendation systems remains underexplored. We propose DualAgent-Rec, an LLM-coordinated dual-agent framework for constrained multi-objective e-commerce recommendation. The framework separates optimization into an Exploitation Agent that prioritizes accuracy under hard constraints and an Exploration Agent that promotes diversity through unconstrained Pareto search. An LLM-based coordinator adaptively allocates resources between agents based on optimization progress and constraint satisfaction, while an adaptive epsilon-relaxation mechanism guarantees feasibility of final solutions. Experiments on the Amazon Reviews 2023 dataset demonstrate that DualAgent-Rec achieves 100% constraint satisfaction and improves Pareto hypervolume by 4-6% over strong baselines, while maintaining competitive accuracy-diversity trade-offs.

Our extensive analysis of ten causal and six masked language models reveals that most models, especially those pre-trained with the masking objective, are overconfident. The best-calibrated scores come from confidence estimates that account for inconsistencies due to statement rephrasing. Moreover, even the largest pre-trained models fail to encode the semantics of linguistic confidence expressions accurately."}

Based on this insight, we propose flatness, a new metric to quantify this property, and develop the Sample-level-flatness-based Dataset Distillation (SFDD) approach, which filters the training data to retain only the most valuable samples. Experiments on the EAGLE framework demonstrate that SFDD can achieve over 2$\\times$ training speedup using only 50% of the data, while keeping the final model's inference speedup within 4% of the full-dataset baseline.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, Similarity Propagation-enhanced Uncertainty for Multimodal Recommendation (SPUMR). SPUMR explicitly models and mitigates uncertainty by first constructing the Modality Similarity Graph and the Collaborative Similarity Graph to refine representations from both content and behavioral perspectives. The Uncertainty-aware Preference Aggregation module then adaptively fuses the refined multimodal features, assigning greater weight to more reliable modalities.

The framework begins by constructing a semantic knowledge graph using sentence-level encoders to strictly align commercial products with authoritative nutritional data. During the training phase, an implicit physics regularizer applies a differentiable thermodynamic loss function, ensuring that learned latent embeddings reflect nutritional plausibility rather than simple popularity. Subsequently, during the inference phase, an explicit physics optimizer employs simulated annealing and elastic quantity optimization to generate discrete grocery bundles that strictly adhere to the user's protein and caloric targets."}

Turing's foundational result established the Halting Problem as undecidable, showing that no algorithm can universally determine termination for all programs and inputs. Consequently, automatic verification tools approximate termination, sometimes failing to prove or disprove; these tools rely on problem-specific architectures and abstractions, and are usually tied to particular programming languages. Recent success and progress in large language models (LLMs) raises the following question: can LLMs reliably predict program termination? In this work, we evaluate LLMs on a diverse set of C programs from the Termination category of the International Competition on Software Verification (SV-Comp) 2025. Our results suggest that LLMs perform remarkably well at predicting program termination, where GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet-4.5 would rank just behind the top-ranked tool (using test-time-scaling), and Code World Model (CWM) would place just behind the second-ranked tool. While LLMs are effective at predicting program termination, they often fail to provide a valid witness as a proof. Moreover, LLMs performance drops as program length increases. We hope these insights motivate further research into program termination and the broader potential of LLMs for reasoning about undecidable problems."}

Naturally, RS place primary emphasis on the quality of the Top-$K$ results rather than performance across the entire item set.

In addition, RS often suffer from distribution shifts due to evolving user preferences or data biases, further complicating the task.\n  To address these issues, we propose Talos, a loss function that is specifically designed to optimize the Talos recommendation accuracy. Talos leverages a quantile technique that replaces the complex ranking-dependent operations into simpler comparisons between predicted scores and learned score thresholds. We further develop a sampling-based regression algorithm for efficient and accurate threshold estimation, and introduce a constraint term to maintain optimization stability by preventing score inflation. Additionally, we incorporate a tailored surrogate function to address discontinuity and enhance robustness against distribution shifts.

We fill the gap by introducing an end-to-end pipeline that first bypasses LLM safeguards through persuasion-based jailbreaking, then reinterprets NLP papers to identify and repurpose their artefacts (datasets, methods, and tools) by exploiting their vulnerabilities, and finally assesses the safety of these proposals using our evaluation framework across three dimensions: harmfulness, feasibility of misuse, and soundness of technicality. Overall, our findings demonstrate that LLMs can generate harmful proposals by repurposing ethically designed open artefacts; however, we find that LLMs acting as evaluators strongly disagree with one another on evaluation outcomes: GPT-4.1 assigns higher scores (indicating greater potential harms, higher soundness and feasibility of misuse), Gemini-2.5-pro is markedly stricter, and Grok-3 falls between these extremes. This indicates that LLMs cannot yet serve as reliable judges in a malicious evaluation setup, making human evaluation essential for credible dual-use risk assessment."}

Yet real-world recommendation signals extend far beyond these modalities. To reflect this, we formalize recommendation features into four modalities: text, images, categorical features, and numerical attributes, and highlight the unique challenges this heterogeneity poses for LLMs in understanding multimodal information. In particular, these challenges arise not only across modalities but also within them, as attributes such as price, rating, and time may all be numeric yet carry distinct semantic meanings. Beyond this intra-modality ambiguity, another major challenge is the nested structure of recommendation signals, where user histories are sequences of items, each associated with multiple attributes. To address these challenges, we propose UniRec, a unified multimodal encoder for LLM-based recommendation. UniRec first employs modality-specific encoders to produce consistent embeddings across heterogeneous signals. It then adopts a triplet representation, comprising attribute name, type, and value, to separate schema from raw inputs and preserve semantic distinctions. Finally, a hierarchical Q-Former models the nested structure of user interactions while maintaining their layered organization. Across multiple real-world benchmarks, UniRec outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal and LLM-based recommenders by up to 15%, and extensive ablation studies further validate the contributions of each component."}

Although existing methods are already competitive in terms of recommendation performance, directly inheriting the autoregressive decoding paradigm from language models still suffers from three key limitations: (1) autoregressive decoding struggles to jointly capture global dependencies among the multi-dimensional features associated with different positions of SID; (2) using a unified, fixed decoding path for the same item implicitly assumes that all users attend to item attributes in the same order; (3) autoregressive decoding is inefficient at inference time and struggles to meet real-time requirements.

Moreover, they are fundamentally mismatched with duplex spoken dialogue systems that generate responses incrementally, where agents must make decisions based on partial utterances. We address these limitations with the first multi-reward RLAIF framework for SDS, combining semantic, audio-quality, and emotion-consistency rewards. To align utterance-level preferences with incremental, blockwise decoding in duplex models, we apply turn-level preference sampling and aggregate per-block log-probabilities within a single DPO objective. We present the first systematic study of preference learning for improving SDS quality in both multi-turn Chain-of-Thought and blockwise duplex models, and release a multi-reward DPO dataset to support reproducible research.

Proactively recommending academic papers that align with scholars' literature needs in the research process has become one of the crucial pathways to enhance research efficiency and stimulate innovative thinking. Current academic paper recommendation systems primarily focus on broad and coarse-grained suggestions based on general topic or field similarities. While these systems effectively identify related literature, they fall short in addressing scholars' more specific and fine-grained needs, such as locating papers that utilize particular research methods, or tackle distinct research tasks within the same topic. To meet the diverse and specific literature needs of scholars in the research process, this paper proposes a novel academic paper recommendation method. This approach embeds multidimensional information by integrating new types of fine-grained knowledge entities, title and abstract of document, and citation data. Recommendations are then generated by calculating the similarity between combined paper vectors. The proposed recommendation method was evaluated using the STM-KG dataset, a knowledge graph that incorporates scientific concepts derived from papers across ten distinct domains. The experimental results indicate that our method outperforms baseline models, achieving an average precision of 27.3% among the top 50 recommendations.

Unlike prior methods, LURE-RAG trains the reranker with a listwise ranking loss guided by LLM utility, thereby directly optimizing the ordering of retrieved documents. Experiments on two standard datasets demonstrate that LURE-RAG achieves competitive performance, reaching 97-98% of the state-of-the-art dense neural baseline, while remaining efficient in both training and inference. Moreover, its dense variant, UR-RAG, significantly outperforms the best existing baseline by up to 3%."}

The government places a strong emphasis on preserving and promoting the Bahnaric language by making it accessible online and encouraging communication across generations. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, such as Neural Machine Translation (NMT), have brought about a transformation in translation by improving accuracy and fluency. This, in turn, contributes to the revival of the language through educational efforts, communication, and documentation. Specifically, NMT is pivotal in enhancing accessibility for Bahnaric speakers, making information and content more readily available. Nevertheless, the translation of Vietnamese into Bahnaric faces practical challenges due to resource constraints, especially given the limited resources available for the Bahnaric language. To address this, we employ state-of-the-art techniques in NMT along with two augmentation strategies for domain-specific Vietnamese-Bahnaric translation task. Importantly, both approaches are flexible and can be used with various neural machine translation models. Additionally, they do not require complex data preprocessing steps, the training of additional systems, or the acquisition of extra data beyond the existing training parallel corpora."}

Using real-world search behaviour, we compare outputs from a bespoke semantic search system applied to UKRI data services with the Consumer Data Research Centre (CDRC) keyword search. Analysis is based on 131 of the most frequently used search terms extracted from CDRC search logs between December 2023 and October 2024. We assess differences in the volume, overlap, ranking, and relevance of returned datasets using descriptive statistics, qualitative inspection, and quantitative similarity measures, including exact dataset overlap, Jaccard similarity, and cosine similarity derived from BERT embeddings. Results show that the semantic search consistently returns a larger number of results than the keyword search and performs particularly well for place based, misspelled, obscure, or complex queries. While the semantic search does not capture all keyword based results, the datasets returned are overwhelmingly semantically similar, with high cosine similarity scores despite lower exact overlap. Rankings of the most relevant results differ substantially between tools, reflecting contrasting prioritisation strategies. Case studies demonstrate that the LLM based tool is robust to spelling errors, interprets geographic and contextual relevance effectively, and supports natural-language queries that keyword search fails to resolve. Overall, the findings suggest that LLM driven semantic search offers a substantial improvement for data discovery, complementing rather than fully replacing traditional keyword-based approaches."}

While recent efforts aim to improve content diversity, they predominantly operate in static or one-shot settings, neglecting the long-term evolution of user interests. Reinforcement learning provides a principled framework for optimizing long-term user satisfaction by modeling sequential decision-making processes. However, its application in recommendation is hindered by sparse, long-tailed user-item interactions and limited semantic planning capabilities. In this work, we propose LLM-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning (LERL), a novel hierarchical recommendation framework that integrates the semantic planning power of LLM with the fine-grained adaptability of RL. LERL consists of a high-level LLM-based planner that selects semantically diverse content categories, and a low-level RL policy that recommends personalized items within the selected semantic space. This hierarchical design narrows the action space, enhances planning efficiency, and mitigates overexposure to redundant content. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that LERL significantly improves long-term user satisfaction when compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

To bridge the gap, we first propose the CONTEXT-VQA (i.e., Conflicting Text) dataset, consisting of image-question pairs together with systematically generated persuasive prompts that deliberately conflict with visual evidence. Then, a thorough evaluation framework is designed and executed to benchmark the susceptibility of various models to these conflicting multimodal inputs. Comprehensive experiments over 11 state-of-the-art VLMs reveal that these models are indeed vulnerable to misleading textual prompts, often overriding clear visual evidence in favor of the conflicting text, and show an average performance drop of over 48.2% after only one round of persuasive conversation. Our findings highlight a critical limitation in current VLMs and underscore the need for improved robustness against textual manipulation."}

Most existing methods treat SIDs as predefined and train recommenders under static indexing. In practice, SIDs are typically optimized only for content reconstruction rather than recommendation accuracy. This leads to an objective mismatch: the system optimizes an indexing loss to learn the SID and a recommendation loss for interaction prediction, but because the tokenizer is trained independently, the recommendation loss cannot update it. A natural approach is to make semantic indexing differentiable so that recommendation gradients can directly influence SID learning, but this often causes codebook collapse, where only a few codes are used. We attribute this issue to early deterministic assignments that limit codebook exploration, resulting in imbalance and unstable optimization.\n  In this paper, we propose DIGER (Differentiable Semantic ID for Generative Recommendation), a first step toward effective differentiable semantic IDs for generative recommendation. DIGER introduces Gumbel noise to explicitly encourage early-stage exploration over codes, mitigating codebook collapse and improving code utilization. To balance exploration and convergence, we further design two uncertainty decay strategies that gradually reduce the Gumbel noise, enabling a smooth transition from early exploration to exploitation of learned SIDs. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate consistent improvements from differentiable semantic IDs. These results confirm the effectiveness of aligning indexing and recommendation objectives through differentiable SIDs and highlight differentiable semantic indexing as a promising research direction."}

In this work, we analyze how these associations emerge from natural language data in attention-based language models through the lens of training dynamics. By leveraging a leading-term approximation of the gradients, we develop closed-form expressions for the weights at early stages of training that explain how semantic associations first take shape. Through our analysis, we reveal that each set of weights of the transformer has closed-form expressions as simple compositions of three basis functions (bigram, token-interchangeability, and context mappings), reflecting the statistics of the text corpus and uncovering how each component of the transformer captures semantic associations based on these compositions. Experiments on real-world LLMs demonstrate that our theoretical weight characterizations closely match the learned weights, and qualitative analyses further show how our theorem shines light on interpreting the learned associations in transformers."}

We provide the first controlled, mechanism-level diagnostic study of whether synchronized iterative retrieval and reasoning can surpass an idealized static upper bound (Gold Context) RAG. We benchmark eleven state-of-the-art LLMs under three regimes: (i) No Context, measuring reliance on parametric memory; (ii) Gold Context, where all oracle evidence is supplied at once; and (iii) Iterative RAG, a training-free controller that alternates retrieval, hypothesis refinement, and evidence-aware stopping. Using the chemistry-focused ChemKGMultiHopQA dataset, we isolate questions requiring genuine retrieval and analyze behavior with diagnostics spanning retrieval coverage gaps, anchor-carry drop, query quality, composition fidelity, and control calibration. Across models, Iterative RAG consistently outperforms Gold Context, with gains up to 25.6 percentage points, especially for non-reasoning fine-tuned models. Staged retrieval reduces late-hop failures, mitigates context overload, and enables dynamic correction of early hypothesis drift, but remaining failure modes include incomplete hop coverage, distractor latch trajectories, early stopping miscalibration, and high composition failure rates even with perfect retrieval. Overall, staged retrieval is often more influential than the mere presence of ideal evidence; we provide practical guidance for deploying and diagnosing RAG systems in specialized scientific settings and a foundation for more reliable, controllable iterative retrieval-reasoning frameworks."}

However, there is a significant lack of research into their internal state as an editable knowledge representation. To fill this gap, we first explore the representational properties of the RWKV state by proposing the DREAMSTATE framework. This framework utilizes a conditional Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to directly model the probability manifold of the state, enabling its generation and editing. The structural nature of this representation is validated through t-SNE visualizations and controlled generation experiments. After successfully uncovering and modeling the state's representational potential, we further propose a novel hybrid architecture that combines the local advantages of RNNs with global context adaptability. This architecture features a parallel DiT that processes a variable-length global context to dynamically generate and adjust the core recurrent module's WKV parameters, transforming the fixed recurrence mechanism into a context-aware dynamic function. Experiments demonstrate that this hybrid model can be trained stably via a multi-objective loss, validating its design feasibility. Our work not only opens a new research direction for RNN state representation but also provides a concrete architectural reference for future model design.

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this issue by grounding answers in external sources, e.g., knowledge graphs (KGs). However, existing KG-based RAG approaches rely on semantics-unaware path sampling and are weakly aligned with KG reasoning objectives, which limits further accuracy gains. They also feed retrieved paths directly into the reasoner without organizing them into answer-centered reasoning paths, hindering small LLMs' ability to leverage the retrieved knowledge. Furthermore, prior works predominantly rely on large LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT/GPT-4) or assume backbones above 7B parameters, leaving sub-7B models underexplored. We address this gap with RPO-RAG, the first KG-based RAG framework specifically designed for small LLMs, to the best of our knowledge. RPO-RAG introduces three key innovations: (1) a query-path semantic sampling strategy that provides informative supervisory signals; (2) a relation-aware preference optimization that aligns training with intermediate KG reasoning signals (e.g., relation); and (3) an answer-centered prompt design that organizes entities and reasoning paths in an interpretable format. Extensive experiments on two benchmark Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, demonstrate that RPO-RAG effectively bridges the performance gap between small and large language models. On WebQSP, it improves F1 by up to 8.8%, reflecting enhanced answer precision, while on CWQ it achieves new state-of-the-art results among models under 8B parameters in both Hit and F1. Overall, RPO-RAG substantially improves the reasoning capability of small LLMs, even under 3B parameters-highlighting their potential for resource-efficient and practical on-device KGQA applications."}

The system includes a triples creator that builds structured facts about a concept, a semantic mapper that selects attributes useful for analogy, a stylized generator that turns them into riddle clues, and a validator that collects all possible answers the riddle could point to. We use this validator to study whether large language models can recover the full answer set for different riddle types.

Inspired by diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs), we propose DART, which leverages parallel generation to reduce drafting latency. DART predicts logits for multiple future masked positions in parallel within a single forward pass based on hidden states of the target model, thereby eliminating autoregressive rollouts in the draft model while preserving a lightweight design. Based on these parallel logit predictions, we further introduce an efficient tree pruning algorithm that constructs high-quality draft token trees with N-gram-enforced semantic continuity. DART substantially reduces draft-stage overhead while preserving high draft accuracy, leading to significantly improved end-to-end decoding speed. Experimental results demonstrate that DART achieves a 2.03x--3.44x wall-clock time speedup across multiple datasets, surpassing EAGLE3 by 30% on average and offering a practical speculative decoding framework.

Large Language Models (LLMs) allowed progress towards addressing this challenge by leveraging parametric medical knowledge to enhance EHR data for clinical prediction tasks. Despite the significant achievements made so far, most of the existing approaches are fundamentally task-agnostic in the sense that they deploy LLMs as EHR encoders or EHR completion modules without fully integrating signals from the prediction tasks. This naturally hinders task performance accuracy. In this work, we propose Rewrite-To-Predict (ReToP), an LLM-based framework that addresses this limitation through an end-to-end training of an EHR rewriter and a clinical predictor. To cope with the lack of EHR rewrite training data, we generate synthetic pseudo-labels using clinical-driven feature selection strategies to create diverse patient rewrites for fine-tuning the EHR rewriter. ReToP aligns the rewriter with prediction objectives using a novel Classifier Supervised Contribution (CSC) score that enables the EHR rewriter to generate clinically relevant rewrites that directly enhance prediction. Our ReToP framework surpasses strong baseline models across three clinical tasks on MIMIC-IV. Moreover, the analysis of ReToP shows its generalizability to unseen datasets and tasks with minimal fine-tuning while preserving faithful rewrites and emphasizing task-relevant predictive features."}

We introduce MetaGen, a training-free framework that adapts both the role space and the collaboration topology at inference time, without updating base model weights. MetaGen generates and rewrites query-conditioned role specifications to maintain a controllable dynamic role pool, then instantiates a constrained execution graph around a minimal backbone. During execution, it iteratively updates role prompts and adjusts structural decisions using lightweight feedback signals.

F-1 first formulates governing equations from problem descriptions, then selects a solving strategy among CoT, PoT, or direct computation based on the generated equations, all within a single LLM call. Results across five models and four benchmarks show F-1 outperforms CoT by +5.76% and PoT by +8.42% on average. Crucially, gains are largest in applied domains: +13.30% on FinanceMath over CoT, and within OlympiadBench, larger gains on physics (+2.55%) than pure math (+0.44%).

One line attempts to identify and remove contaminated benchmark items before evaluation, but this inevitably alters the evaluation set itself and becomes unreliable when contamination is moderate or severe. The other line preserves the benchmark and instead suppresses contaminated behavior at evaluation time; however, such interventions often interfere with normal inference and lead to noticeable performance degradation on clean inputs. We propose DeconIEP, a decontamination framework that operates entirely during evaluation by applying small, bounded perturbations in the input embedding space. Guided by a relatively less-contaminated reference model, DeconIEP learns an instance-adaptive perturbation generator that steers the evaluated model away from memorization-driven shortcut pathways.

We adapt the Cross-Examination Framework (CEF) for a reference-free, multi-dimensional evaluation by treating the source and candidate as independent knowledge bases. CEF generates verifiable questions from each text and performs a cross-examination to derive three interpretable scores: Coverage, Conformity, and Consistency. Validated across translation, summarization and clinical note-generation, our framework identifies critical errors, such as content omissions and factual contradictions, missed by standard metrics. A key contribution is a systematic robustness analysis to select a stable judge model. Crucially, the strong correlation between our reference-free and with-reference modes validates CEF's reliability without gold references. Furthermore, human expert validation demonstrates that CEF mismatching questions align with meaning-altering semantic errors higher than with non-semantic errors, particularly excelling at identifying entity-based and relational distortions."}

Although recent large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong translation capabilities, their effectiveness for APE--especially under document-level context--remains insufficiently understood. We present a systematic comparison of proprietary and open-weight LLMs under a naive document-level prompting setup, analyzing APE quality, contextual behavior, robustness, and efficiency.\n  Our results show that proprietary LLMs achieve near human-level APE quality even with simple one-shot prompting, regardless of whether document context is provided. While these models exhibit higher robustness to data poisoning attacks than open-weight counterparts, this robustness also reveals a limitation: they largely fail to exploit document-level context for contextual error correction. Furthermore, standard automatic metrics do not reliably reflect these qualitative improvements, highlighting the continued necessity of human evaluation. Despite their strong performance, the substantial cost and latency overheads of proprietary LLMs render them impractical for real-world APE deployment. Overall, our findings elucidate both the promise and current limitations of LLM-based document-aware APE, and point toward the need for more efficient long-context modeling approaches for translation refinement."}

This is particularly important because debunking false information typically takes longer to reach consumers than the misinformation itself; accelerating corrections through automation can therefore help counter it more effectively. Although many organizations perform manual fact-checking, this approach is difficult to scale given the growing volume of digital content. These limitations have motivated interest in automating fact-checking, where identifying claims is a crucial first step. However, progress has been uneven across languages, with English dominating due to abundant annotated data. Portuguese, like other languages, still lacks accessible, licensed datasets, limiting research, NLP developments and applications. In this paper, we introduce ClaimPT, a dataset of European Portuguese news articles annotated for factual claims, comprising 1,308 articles and 6,875 individual annotations. Unlike most existing resources based on social media or parliamentary transcripts, ClaimPT focuses on journalistic content, collected through a partnership with LUSA, the Portuguese News Agency. To ensure annotation quality, two trained annotators labeled each article, with a curator validating all annotations according to a newly proposed scheme. We also provide baseline models for claim detection, establishing initial benchmarks and enabling future NLP and IR applications. By releasing ClaimPT, we aim to advance research on low-resource fact-checking and enhance understanding of misinformation in news media."}

Structured pruning methods are primarily employed to improve the inference efficiency of pre-trained models. Meanwhile, they often require additional time and memory for training, knowledge distillation, structure search, and other strategies, making efficient model fine-tuning challenging to achieve. To simultaneously enhance the training and inference efficiency of downstream task fine-tuning, we introduce GradPruner, which can prune layers of LLMs guided by gradients in the early stages of fine-tuning. GradPruner uses the cumulative gradients of each parameter during the initial phase of fine-tuning to compute the Initial Gradient Information Accumulation Matrix (IGIA-Matrix) to assess the importance of layers and perform pruning. We sparsify the pruned layers based on the IGIA-Matrix and merge them with the remaining layers. Only elements with the same sign are merged to reduce interference from sign variations. We conducted extensive experiments on two LLMs across eight downstream datasets. Including medical, financial, and general benchmark tasks. The results demonstrate that GradPruner has achieved a parameter reduction of 40% with only a 0.99% decrease in accuracy. Our code is publicly available."}

However, scaling such refinement to naturalistic NLI remains difficult: long, syntactically rich inputs and deep multi-step arguments amplify autoformalisation errors, where a single local mismatch can invalidate the proof. Moreover, current methods often handle failures via costly global regeneration due to the difficulty of localising the responsible span or step from prover diagnostics. Aiming to address these problems, we propose a decompose-and-formalise framework that (i) decomposes premise-hypothesis pairs into an entailment tree of atomic steps, (ii) verifies the tree bottom-up to isolate failures to specific nodes, and (iii) performs local diagnostic-guided refinement instead of regenerating the whole explanation. Moreover, to improve faithfulness of autoformalisation, we introduce $θ$-substitution in an event-based logical form to enforce consistent argument-role bindings. Across a range of reasoning tasks using five LLM backbones, our method achieves the highest explanation verification rates, improving over the state-of-the-art by 26.2%, 21.7%, 21.6% and 48.9%, while reducing refinement iterations and runtime and preserving strong NLI accuracy."}

To overcome this limitation, we introduce PIP: a Parallel Inference Paradigm for KIE. Our approach reformulates the problem by using \"[mask]\" tokens as placeholders for all target values, enabling their simultaneous generation in a single forward pass. To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a tailored mask pre-training strategy and construct large-scale supervised datasets. Experimental results show that our PIP-models achieve a 5-36x inference speedup with negligible performance degradation compared to traditional autoregressive base models.

Our analysis indicates that sink tokens exhibit low-norm representations in the Transformer's value space, and that the moving sink phenomenon serves as a protective mechanism in DLMs to prevent excessive information mixing. However, their unpredictable positions across diffusion steps undermine inference robustness. To resolve this, we propose a simple but effective extra sink token implemented via a modified attention mask. Specifically, we introduce a special token constrained to attend solely to itself, while remaining globally visible to all other tokens. Experimental results demonstrate that introducing a single extra token stabilizes attention sinks, substantially improving model performance. Crucially, further analysis confirms that the effectiveness of this token is independent of its position and characterized by negligible semantic content, validating its role as a robust and dedicated structural sink."}

Such models could provide scalable proxies for testing rehabilitation hypotheses, and offer a controlled framework for probing the functional organization of language. We introduce a clinically grounded, component-level framework that simulates aphasia by selectively perturbing functional components in LLMs, and apply it to both modular Mixture-of-Experts models and dense Transformers using a unified intervention interface. Our pipeline (i) identifies subtype-linked components for Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia, (ii) interprets these components with linguistic probing tasks, and (iii) induces graded impairments by progressively perturbing the top-k subtype-linked components, evaluating outcomes with Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) subtests summarized by Aphasia Quotient (AQ). Across architectures and lesioning strategies, subtype-targeted perturbations yield more systematic, aphasia-like regressions than size-matched random perturbations, and MoE modularity supports more localized and interpretable phenotype-to-component mappings. These findings suggest that modular LLMs, combined with clinically informed component perturbations, provide a promising platform for simulating aphasic language production and studying how distinct language functions degrade under targeted disruptions."}

We provide the first controlled, mechanism-level diagnostic study of whether synchronized iterative retrieval and reasoning can surpass an idealized static upper bound (Gold Context) RAG. We benchmark eleven state-of-the-art LLMs under three regimes: (i) No Context, measuring reliance on parametric memory; (ii) Gold Context, where all oracle evidence is supplied at once; and (iii) Iterative RAG, a training-free controller that alternates retrieval, hypothesis refinement, and evidence-aware stopping. Using the chemistry-focused ChemKGMultiHopQA dataset, we isolate questions requiring genuine retrieval and analyze behavior with diagnostics spanning retrieval coverage gaps, anchor-carry drop, query quality, composition fidelity, and control calibration. Across models, Iterative RAG consistently outperforms Gold Context, with gains up to 25.6 percentage points, especially for non-reasoning fine-tuned models. Staged retrieval reduces late-hop failures, mitigates context overload, and enables dynamic correction of early hypothesis drift, but remaining failure modes include incomplete hop coverage, distractor latch trajectories, early stopping miscalibration, and high composition failure rates even with perfect retrieval. Overall, staged retrieval is often more influential than the mere presence of ideal evidence; we provide practical guidance for deploying and diagnosing RAG systems in specialized scientific settings and a foundation for more reliable, controllable iterative retrieval-reasoning frameworks."}

Accepted to the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Multilingual Representation Learning (Mexico City) and the AAAI 2025 Workshop on Language Models for Under-Resourced Communities (LM4UC). Code and data available at: https://github.com/Nickcheng123/reflective-translation-mt", "summary": "Low-resource languages such as isiZulu and isiXhosa face persistent challenges in machine translation due to limited parallel data and linguistic resources. Recent advances in large language models suggest that self-reflection, prompting a model to critique and revise its own outputs, can improve reasoning quality and factual consistency. Building on this idea, this paper introduces Reflective Translation, a prompt-based framework in which a model generates an initial translation, produces a structured self-critique, and then uses this reflection to generate a refined translation. The approach is evaluated on English-isiZulu and English-isiXhosa translation using OPUS-100 and NTREX-African, across multiple prompting strategies and confidence thresholds. Results show consistent improvements in both BLEU and COMET scores between first- and second-pass translations, with average gains of up to +0.22 BLEU and +0.18 COMET. Statistical significance testing using paired nonparametric tests confirms that these improvements are robust. The proposed method is model-agnostic, requires no fine-tuning, and introduces a reflection-augmented dataset that can support future supervised or analysis-driven work. These findings demonstrate that structured self-reflection is a practical and effective mechanism for improving translation quality in low-resource settings."}

In this work, we present ONCOTIMIA, a modular and secure clinical tool designed to integrate generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) into oncology workflows and evaluate its application to the automatic completion of lung cancer tumour board forms using large language models (LLMs). The system combines a multi-layer data lake, hybrid relational and vector storage, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and a rule-driven adaptive form model to transform unstructured clinical documentation into structured and standardised tumour board records. We assess the performance of six LLMs deployed through AWS Bedrock on ten lung cancer cases, measuring both completion form accuracy and end-to-end latency. The results demonstrate high performance across models, with the best performing configuration achieving an 80% of correct field completion and clinically acceptable response time for most LLMs. Larger and more recent models exhibit best accuracies without incurring prohibitive latency. These findings provide empirical evidence that LLM- assisted autocompletion form is technically feasible and operationally viable in multidisciplinary lung cancer workflows and support its potential to significantly reduce documentation burden while preserving data quality."}

Motivated by the growing use of RAG systems across diverse languages, we explore several strategies to generalize the Provence framework-which first integrated efficient zero-cost context pruning directly into the re-ranking model-beyond English. Across four multilingual question answering benchmarks, we show how XProvence can prune RAG contexts with minimal-to-no performance degradation and outperforms strong baselines.

Proactively recommending academic papers that align with scholars' literature needs in the research process has become one of the crucial pathways to enhance research efficiency and stimulate innovative thinking. Current academic paper recommendation systems primarily focus on broad and coarse-grained suggestions based on general topic or field similarities. While these systems effectively identify related literature, they fall short in addressing scholars' more specific and fine-grained needs, such as locating papers that utilize particular research methods, or tackle distinct research tasks within the same topic. To meet the diverse and specific literature needs of scholars in the research process, this paper proposes a novel academic paper recommendation method. This approach embeds multidimensional information by integrating new types of fine-grained knowledge entities, title and abstract of document, and citation data. Recommendations are then generated by calculating the similarity between combined paper vectors. The proposed recommendation method was evaluated using the STM-KG dataset, a knowledge graph that incorporates scientific concepts derived from papers across ten distinct domains. The experimental results indicate that our method outperforms baseline models, achieving an average precision of 27.3% among the top 50 recommendations. This represents an improvement of 6.7% over existing approaches."}
