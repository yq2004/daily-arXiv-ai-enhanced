Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自动归因方法，将摘要中的每个句子链接到源文本的特定部分，使用混合摘要技术来简化归因过程，并通过定制拓扑识别归因相关错误的比例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析师需要归因，因为不知道信息来源就无法报告任何内容。本文旨在解决自动归因的问题，确保摘要中的每个句子都能追溯到源文本的具体部分。

Method: 采用混合摘要方法（即抽取式摘要的自动释义）来简化归因过程，并使用定制拓扑来识别不同类别归因相关错误的比例。

Result: 开发了自动归因方法，能够将摘要句子与源文本部分进行链接，并通过混合摘要技术提高了归因的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: 混合摘要方法和定制拓扑分析为自动归因提供了有效解决方案，能够识别和分类归因相关错误，提升了信息归因的可靠性。

Abstract: Analysts require attribution, as nothing can be reported without knowing the source of the information. In this paper, we will focus on automatic methods for attribution, linking each sentence in the summary to a portion of the source text, which may be in one or more documents. We explore using a hybrid summarization, i.e., an automatic paraphrase of an extractive summary, to ease attribution. We also use a custom topology to identify the proportion of different categories of attribution-related errors.

TL;DR: Bi-RAR是一个新颖的检索增强推理框架，通过双向评估中间步骤来改进多步推理，使用基于Kolmogorov复杂度的双向信息距离和强化学习优化推理质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索增强生成方法在复杂多步推理场景中效果有限，大多数方法依赖结果监督，缺乏对中间步骤的明确指导，导致奖励破解和响应质量下降。

Method: 提出Bi-RAR框架，双向评估每个中间步骤的信息完整性，引入基于Kolmogorov复杂度的双向信息距离，采用多目标强化学习框架和级联奖励结构。

Result: 在七个问答基准测试上的实证结果表明，Bi-RAR超越了先前的方法，在训练和推理过程中实现了与搜索引擎的高效交互和推理。

Conclusion: Bi-RAR通过双向评估中间推理步骤，有效提升了检索增强生成在复杂多步推理任务中的性能，解决了现有方法中的奖励破解问题。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven to be effective in mitigating hallucinations in large language models, yet its effectiveness remains limited in complex, multi-step reasoning scenarios.Recent efforts have incorporated search-based interactions into RAG, enabling iterative reasoning with real-time retrieval. Most approaches rely on outcome-based supervision, offering no explicit guidance for intermediate steps. This often leads to reward hacking and degraded response quality. We propose Bi-RAR, a novel retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that evaluates each intermediate step jointly in both forward and backward directions. To assess the information completeness of each step, we introduce a bidirectional information distance grounded in Kolmogorov complexity, approximated via language model generation probabilities. This quantification measures both how far the current reasoning is from the answer and how well it addresses the question. To optimize reasoning under these bidirectional signals, we adopt a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework with a cascading reward structure that emphasizes early trajectory alignment. Empirical results on seven question answering benchmarks demonstrate that Bi-RAR surpasses previous methods and enables efficient interaction and reasoning with the search engine during training and inference.

### [3] [GMTRouter: Personalized LLM Router over Multi-turn User Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08590)
*Encheng Xie,Yihang Sun,Tao Feng,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GMTRouter是一个基于异构图学习的个性化LLM路由框架，通过将用户-LLM多轮交互建模为异构图，在少样本数据下有效学习用户偏好，实现个性化路由决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM路由方法缺乏充分个性化，难以捕捉用户与LLM之间的复杂交互关系，且用户偏好数据通常稀缺、噪声大、格式不一致，限制了仅依赖用户特定数据的方法效果。

Method: 将多轮用户-LLM交互表示为包含用户、LLM、查询和响应四种节点类型的异构图，通过定制的消息传递机制，在轻量级归纳图学习框架中从少样本数据学习用户偏好。

Result: 在多个数据集上，GMTRouter始终优于强基线方法，准确率提高0.9%到21.6%，AUC提高0.006到0.309。更重要的是，仅使用少样本数据即可适应新用户和演化偏好，无需大量微调。

Conclusion: GMTRouter通过异构图表示和消息传递机制，有效解决了LLM路由中的个性化挑战，在少样本场景下实现了优异的性能，并能适应新用户和动态偏好变化。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) routing has demonstrated strong capability in balancing response quality with computational cost. As users exhibit diverse preferences, personalization has attracted increasing attention in LLM routing, since even identical queries may require different models to generate responses tailored to individual needs. However, existing approaches are not fully personalized and often fail to capture the complex interactions between specific users and LLMs. Moreover, user preference data is typically scarce, noisy, and inconsistent in format, which limits the effectiveness of methods that rely solely on user-specific data. To address these challenges, we propose GMTRouter, which represents multi-turn user-LLM interactions as a heterogeneous graph with four node types: user, LLM, query, and response, thereby preserving the rich relational structure of the interaction. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, GMTRouter learns to capture user preferences from few-shot data within a lightweight inductive graph learning framework, enabling effective personalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMTRouter consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.9 to 21.6 percent higher accuracy and 0.006 to 0.309 higher AUC across multiple datasets. More importantly, we demonstrate that GMTRouter can adapt to new users and evolving preferences using only few-shot data, without extensive fine-tuning. The code for GMTRouter is publicly available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/GMTRouter.

### [4] [The Collective Turing Test: Large Language Models Can Generate Realistic Multi-User Discussions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08592)
*Azza Bouleimen,Giordano De Marzo,Taehee Kim,Nicol`o Pagan,Hannah Metzler,Silvia Giordano,David Garcia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can generate social media conversations that are often mistaken for human-created content, with participants correctly identifying AI-generated conversations only 56% of the time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether LLMs can convincingly mimic human group conversations on social media and test the validity of using LLMs to simulate online communities.

Method: Collected authentic human conversations from Reddit and generated artificial conversations on the same topics using Llama 3 70B and GPT-4o. Presented both human and AI-generated conversations side-by-side to study participants for identification.

Result: LLM-generated conversations were mistaken for human-created content 39% of the time. Participants correctly identified Llama 3-generated conversations as AI only 56% of the time, barely better than random chance.

Conclusion: LLMs can generate sufficiently realistic social media conversations to deceive humans, highlighting both promising potential for social simulation and warning about potential misuse for generating inauthentic content.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new avenues to simulate online communities and social media. Potential applications range from testing the design of content recommendation algorithms to estimating the effects of content policies and interventions. However, the validity of using LLMs to simulate conversations between various users remains largely untested. We evaluated whether LLMs can convincingly mimic human group conversations on social media. We collected authentic human conversations from Reddit and generated artificial conversations on the same topic with two LLMs: Llama 3 70B and GPT-4o. When presented side-by-side to study participants, LLM-generated conversations were mistaken for human-created content 39\% of the time. In particular, when evaluating conversations generated by Llama 3, participants correctly identified them as AI-generated only 56\% of the time, barely better than random chance. Our study demonstrates that LLMs can generate social media conversations sufficiently realistic to deceive humans when reading them, highlighting both a promising potential for social simulation and a warning message about the potential misuse of LLMs to generate new inauthentic social media content.

### [5] [Knowledge Graph Analysis of Legal Understanding and Violations in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08593)
*Abha Jha,Abel Salinas,Fred Morstatter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在分析生物武器法律方面存在矛盾：既能解读法律，又可能生成危险内容。研究提出结合知识图谱和RAG的方法评估LLM的法律理解和安全漏洞，发现其推理和安全机制存在显著局限，但为开发更安全的LLM法律助手提供了方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在法律分析领域具有变革潜力，但存在安全隐患——在解读生物武器法律的同时可能生成危险的操作指南，这种矛盾需要系统评估和解决。

Method: 整合知识图谱构建与检索增强生成(RAG)，系统评估LLM对生物武器法律的理解能力、法律意图判断能力以及生成不安全内容的风险。

Result: 研究发现LLMs在法律推理和安全机制方面存在显著局限性，但通过结构化实验验证了评估方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过增强安全协议和强化法律推理框架，可以开发出能安全协助敏感法律领域的LLMs，确保其成为法律的保护者而非无意中的违反者。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential for interpreting complex legal frameworks, such as Title 18 Section 175 of the US Code, which governs biological weapons. These systems hold promise for advancing legal analysis and compliance monitoring in sensitive domains. However, this capability comes with a troubling contradiction: while LLMs can analyze and interpret laws, they also demonstrate alarming vulnerabilities in generating unsafe outputs, such as actionable steps for bioweapon creation, despite their safeguards. To address this challenge, we propose a methodology that integrates knowledge graph construction with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to systematically evaluate LLMs' understanding of this law, their capacity to assess legal intent (mens rea), and their potential for unsafe applications. Through structured experiments, we assess their accuracy in identifying legal violations, generating prohibited instructions, and detecting unlawful intent in bioweapons-related scenarios. Our findings reveal significant limitations in LLMs' reasoning and safety mechanisms, but they also point the way forward. By combining enhanced safety protocols with more robust legal reasoning frameworks, this research lays the groundwork for developing LLMs that can ethically and securely assist in sensitive legal domains - ensuring they act as protectors of the law rather than inadvertent enablers of its violation.

### [6] [Diverse Preference Learning for Capabilities and Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08594)
*Stewart Slocum,Asher Parker-Sartori,Dylan Hadfield-Menell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Soft Preference Learning方法，通过解耦KL散度正则化中的熵和交叉熵项，解决RLHF和DPO等对齐算法导致的LLM输出多样性下降问题，在保持能力的同时提升观点多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐算法（如RLHF、DPO）显著降低了LLM输出的多样性，导致模型生成重复结构、统一思维方式，并反映更窄的社会观点范围，这归因于KL散度正则化使模型过度加权多数意见。

Method: 提出Soft Preference Learning方法，解构KL散度正则化中的熵和交叉熵项，实现对LLM生成多样性的精细控制。

Result: 在能力方面，使用Soft Preference Learning训练的LLM在困难重复采样任务中准确率更高，输出具有更大的语义和词汇多样性；在对齐方面，能够代表更广泛的社会观点，并改善logit校准。

Conclusion: Soft Preference Learning是对标准温度缩放的帕累托改进，能有效平衡LLM的能力与多样性，解决对齐算法带来的观点单一化问题。

Abstract: The ability of LLMs to represent diverse perspectives is critical as they increasingly impact society. However, recent studies reveal that alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO significantly reduce the diversity of LLM outputs. Not only do aligned LLMs generate text with repetitive structure and word choice, they also approach problems in more uniform ways, and their responses reflect a narrower range of societal perspectives. We attribute this problem to the KL divergence regularizer employed in preference learning algorithms. This causes the model to systematically overweight majority opinions and sacrifice diversity in its outputs. To address this, we propose Soft Preference Learning, which decouples the entropy and cross-entropy terms in the KL penalty - allowing for fine-grained control over LLM generation diversity. From a capabilities perspective, LLMs trained using Soft Preference Learning attain higher accuracy on difficult repeated sampling tasks and produce outputs with greater semantic and lexical diversity. From an alignment perspective, they are capable of representing a wider range of societal viewpoints and display improved logit calibration. Notably, Soft Preference Learning resembles, but is a Pareto improvement over, standard temperature scaling.

### [7] [Chopping Trees: Semantic Similarity Based Dynamic Pruning for Tree-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08595)
*Joongho Kim,Xirui Huang,Zarreen Reza,Gabriel Grand,Kevin Zhu,Ryan Lagasse*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SSDP是一种轻量级方法，通过在线语义合并和动态剪枝，显著提升树状思维推理的效率，在保持竞争力的准确率同时实现2.3倍加速和85-90%的节点探索减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 树状思维推理虽然提升了大型语言模型的解决问题能力，但由于语义冗余导致计算成本高昂，不同分支可能探索等效的推理路径。

Method: 引入基于语义相似度的动态剪枝方法，首次将在线语义合并集成到并行化树搜索中，实时聚类和剪枝冗余步骤。

Result: 在GSM8K和MATH500等推理基准测试中，SSDP相比最先进的树搜索基线实现了2.3倍加速，准确率保持在最强基线的5%以内，探索节点数减少85-90%。

Conclusion: SSDP为高效、可扩展的LLM推理提供了一种实用方法，在显著提升效率的同时保持了竞争力。

Abstract: Tree-of-Thought (ToT) reasoning boosts the problem-solving abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) but is computationally expensive due to semantic redundancy, where distinct branches explore equivalent reasoning paths. We introduce Semantic Similarity-Based Dynamic Pruning (SSDP), a lightweight method that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first framework to integrate online semantic merging into parallelized tree search, enabling the clustering and pruning of redundant steps in real time. Across reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K and MATH500, SSDP achieves up to a 2.3x speedup over state-of-the-art tree-search baselines while maintaining competitive accuracy (typically within 5% of the strongest baseline) and reducing the number of explored nodes by 85-90%, demonstrating a practical approach to efficient, scalable LLM reasoning. The implementation of SSDP is publicly available at https://github.com/kimjoonghokim/SSDP.

### [8] [What About the Scene with the Hitler Reference? HAUNT: A Framework to Probe LLMs' Self-consistency Via Adversarial Nudge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08596)
*Arka Dutta,Sujan Dutta,Rijul Magu,Soumyajit Datta,Munmun De Choudhury,Ashiqur R. KhudaBukhsh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个框架来测试大型语言模型在对抗性提示下的真实性保真度，通过让模型自己生成和验证真假陈述，然后测试其对自身生成谎言的抵抗力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 幻觉问题是大型语言模型在关键领域部署的主要挑战，需要测试模型在对抗性提示下的真实性保真度。

Method: 框架包含三个步骤：1) 让LLM生成与特定封闭领域一致的真假陈述；2) 让LLM验证这些陈述的真假；3) 测试LLM对自身生成谎言的抵抗力。

Result: 在电影和小说两个封闭领域的评估显示，不同LLM对对抗性提示的抵抗力差异很大：Claude表现出强韧性，GPT和Grok中等韧性，Gemini和DeepSeek韧性较弱。

Conclusion: 随着越来越多的人使用LLM进行信息搜索，这些发现敲响了警钟，表明需要提高LLM对对抗性提示的抵抗力。

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a critical challenge to the real-world deployment of large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains. In this paper, we present a framework for stress testing factual fidelity in LLMs in the presence of adversarial nudge. Our framework consists of three steps. In the first step, we instruct the LLM to produce sets of truths and lies consistent with the closed domain in question. In the next step, we instruct the LLM to verify the same set of assertions as truths and lies consistent with the same closed domain. In the final step, we test the robustness of the LLM against the lies generated (and verified) by itself. Our extensive evaluation, conducted using five widely known proprietary LLMs across two closed domains of popular movies and novels, reveals a wide range of susceptibility to adversarial nudges: \texttt{Claude} exhibits strong resilience, \texttt{GPT} and \texttt{Grok} demonstrate moderate resilience, while \texttt{Gemini} and \texttt{DeepSeek} show weak resilience. Considering that a large population is increasingly using LLMs for information seeking, our findings raise alarm.

### [9] [Self-HarmLLM: Can Large Language Model Harm Itself?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08597)
*Heehwan Kim,Sungjune Park,Daeseon Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Self-HarmLLM攻击场景，利用同一模型生成的缓解有害查询作为新输入进行越狱攻击，在多种模型和条件下实现了显著的成功率，并发现自动评估会高估越狱成功率52%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御系统假设攻击者来自外部，但未充分探索模型自身输出成为新攻击向量的可能性。

Method: 提出Self-HarmLLM场景，使用同一模型生成的Mitigated Harmful Query作为新输入进行越狱测试，在GPT-3.5-turbo等模型上进行了Base、Zero-shot和Few-shot条件实验。

Result: Zero-shot条件下转换成功率最高52%，越狱成功率最高33%；Few-shot条件下转换成功率最高65%，越狱成功率最高41%。自动评估比人工评估平均高估52%的越狱成功率。

Conclusion: 该方法证明是有效的攻击场景，表明需要重新考虑护栏设计并建立更鲁棒的评估方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are generally equipped with guardrails to block the generation of harmful responses. However, existing defenses always assume that an external attacker crafts the harmful query, and the possibility of a model's own output becoming a new attack vector has not been sufficiently explored. In this study, we propose the Self-HarmLLM scenario, which uses a Mitigated Harmful Query (MHQ) generated by the same model as a new input. An MHQ is an ambiguous query whose original intent is preserved while its harmful nature is not directly exposed. We verified whether a jailbreak occurs when this MHQ is re-entered into a separate session of the same model. We conducted experiments on GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B-instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B under Base, Zero-shot, and Few-shot conditions. The results showed up to 52% transformation success rate and up to 33% jailbreak success rate in the Zero-shot condition, and up to 65% transformation success rate and up to 41% jailbreak success rate in the Few-shot condition. By performing both prefix-based automated evaluation and human evaluation, we found that the automated evaluation consistently overestimated jailbreak success, with an average difference of 52%. This indicates that automated evaluation alone is not accurate for determining harmfulness. While this study is a toy-level study based on a limited query set and evaluators, it proves that our method can still be a valid attack scenario. These results suggest the need for a fundamental reconsideration of guardrail design and the establishment of a more robust evaluation methodology.

### [10] [OKBench: Democratizing LLM Evaluation with Fully Automated, On-Demand, Open Knowledge Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08598)
*Yanhong Li,Tianyang Xu,Kenan Tang,Karen Livescu,David McAllester,Jiawei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OKBench是一个全自动框架，用于按需生成高质量、动态的知识基准测试，特别关注新闻领域，通过代理框架自动化基准的获取、创建、验证和分发。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态基准测试无法捕捉动态世界中的知识演变，集中式管理难以跟上LLM的快速发展步伐。

Method: 提出OKBench框架，采用代理式方法自动化基准测试的整个生命周期，包括知识获取、基准创建、质量验证和分发，特别减少与预训练数据的重叠。

Result: 评估了各种规模和配置的开源和专有LLM，结果显示模型在面对新信息时表现出不同行为，检索缩小了大小模型之间的性能差距。

Conclusion: 在演化知识基准上评估LLM至关重要，OKBench框架能够民主化基准创建并促进检索增强方法的全面评估。

Abstract: Knowledge-intensive question answering is central to large language models (LLMs) and is typically assessed using static benchmarks derived from sources like Wikipedia and textbooks. However, these benchmarks fail to capture evolving knowledge in a dynamic world, and centralized curation struggles to keep pace with rapid LLM advancements. To address these drawbacks, we propose Open Knowledge Bench (OKBench), a fully automated framework for generating high-quality, dynamic knowledge benchmarks on demand. Focusing on the news domain where knowledge updates daily, OKBench is an agentic framework that automates the sourcing, creation, validation, and distribution of benchmarks. Our approach democratizes benchmark creation and facilitates thorough evaluation of retrieval-augmented methods by reducing overlap with pretraining data. We evaluate our framework on a wide range open-source and proprietary LLMs of various sizes and configurations, both with and without retrieval over freshly generated knowledge. Our results reveal distinct model behaviors when confronted with new information and highlight how retrieval narrows the performance gap between small and large models. These findings underscore the importance of evaluating LLMs on evolving knowledge benchmarks.

### [11] [Retrieval-Augmented Generation of Pediatric Speech-Language Pathology vignettes: A Proof-of-Concept Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08600)
*Yilan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个结合检索增强生成（RAG）和领域知识库的系统，用于自动生成儿科言语语言病理学临床案例，解决了传统手动创建耗时且LLM缺乏专业知识的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床案例是言语语言病理学教育的重要工具，但手动创建耗时费力。通用大语言模型虽然能生成文本，但缺乏领域专业知识，容易产生幻觉内容且需要大量专家修订。

Method: 开发了多模型RAG系统原型，整合了精选领域知识和工程化提示模板，支持五个商业（GPT-4o、Claude 3.5 Sonnet、Gemini 2.5 Pro）和开源（Llama 3.2、Qwen 2.5-7B）LLM。设计了七个涵盖不同障碍类型和年级水平的测试场景。

Result: 概念验证表明RAG增强生成儿科SLP案例在技术上可行。商业模型显示出边际质量优势，但开源替代方案达到了可接受的性能，暗示了隐私保护机构部署的潜力。整合精选知识库使内容生成与专业指南保持一致。

Conclusion: 该系统展示了自动生成儿科SLP临床案例的技术可行性，但需要在教育或研究实施前进行专家评审、学生试点测试和心理测量评估的广泛验证。未来应用可能扩展到临床决策支持、自动化IEP目标生成和临床反思训练。

Abstract: Clinical vignettes are essential educational tools in speech-language pathology (SLP), but manual creation is time-intensive. While general-purpose large language models (LLMs) can generate text, they lack domain-specific knowledge, leading to hallucinations and requiring extensive expert revision. This study presents a proof-of-concept system integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with curated knowledge bases to generate pediatric SLP case materials. A multi-model RAG-based system was prototyped integrating curated domain knowledge with engineered prompt templates, supporting five commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) and open-source (Llama 3.2, Qwen 2.5-7B) LLMs. Seven test scenarios spanning diverse disorder types and grade levels were systematically designed. Generated cases underwent automated quality assessment using a multi-dimensional rubric evaluating structural completeness, internal consistency, clinical appropriateness, and IEP goal/session note quality. This proof-of-concept demonstrates technical feasibility for RAG-augmented generation of pediatric SLP vignettes. Commercial models showed marginal quality advantages, but open-source alternatives achieved acceptable performance, suggesting potential for privacy-preserving institutional deployment. Integration of curated knowledge bases enabled content generation aligned with professional guidelines. Extensive validation through expert review, student pilot testing, and psychometric evaluation is required before educational or research implementation. Future applications may extend to clinical decision support, automated IEP goal generation, and clinical reflection training.

### [12] [Evaluating DisCoCirc in Translation Tasks & its Limitations: A Comparative Study Between Bengali & English](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08601)
*Nazmoon Falgunee Moon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文扩展了DisCoCirc形式化框架到孟加拉语，用于英孟翻译任务，发现该框架在减少语言官僚主义方面存在局限性，特别是在处理结构差异时表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将DisCoCirc形式化框架从英语扩展到孟加拉语，评估其在英孟翻译任务中的有效性，并重新评估该框架在减少语言官僚主义方面的能力。

Method: 基于DisCoCirc的语法生产规则和电路表示方法，开发孟加拉语的类似框架，并将其应用于英孟翻译任务，同时分析框架在处理语言结构差异时的局限性。

Result: 研究发现DisCoCirc框架虽然对大部分语言有效，但由于两种语言的结构差异，在翻译任务中仍面临限制，即使处理简单句子也存在困难。

Conclusion: DisCoCirc框架在跨语言翻译中存在局限性，这突显了该框架的约束条件，并为未来改进提供了方向。同时揭示了连词与布尔逻辑之间的联系。

Abstract: In [4], the authors present the DisCoCirc (Distributed Compositional Circuits) formalism for the English language, a grammar-based framework derived from the production rules that incorporates circuit-like representations in order to give a precise categorical theoretical structure to the language. In this paper, we extend this approach to develop a similar framework for Bengali and apply it to translation tasks between English and Bengali. A central focus of our work lies in reassessing the effectiveness of DisCoCirc in reducing language bureaucracy. Unlike the result suggested in [5], our findings indicate that although it works well for a large part of the language, it still faces limitations due to the structural variation of the two languages. We discuss the possible methods that might handle these shortcomings and show that, in practice, DisCoCirc still struggles even with relatively simple sentences. This divergence from prior claims not only highlights the framework's constraints in translation but also suggest scope for future improvement. Apart from our primary focus on English-Bengali translation, we also take a short detour to examine English conjunctions, following [1], showing a connection between conjunctions and Boolean logic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉国低收入人群面临法律语言复杂、程序不透明和成本高等障碍，现有AI法律助手缺乏孟加拉语支持和本地化适配。

Method: 采用多语言嵌入和基于RAG的工具链框架，实现检索、推理、翻译和文档生成功能，通过交互式聊天界面提供服务。

Result: 在2022和2023年孟加拉律师委员会考试评估中，Mina在选择题、笔试和模拟口试中得分75-80%，达到或超过人类平均水平，展现了清晰性、上下文理解和法律推理能力。

Conclusion: Mina证明了作为低成本多语言AI助手的潜力，能够自动化关键法律任务并扩大司法可及性，为构建领域特定、低资源系统提供了实际案例研究。

Abstract: Bangladesh's low-income population faces major barriers to affordable legal advice due to complex legal language, procedural opacity, and high costs. Existing AI legal assistants lack Bengali-language support and jurisdiction-specific adaptation, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we developed Mina, a multilingual LLM-based legal assistant tailored for the Bangladeshi context. It employs multilingual embeddings and a RAG-based chain-of-tools framework for retrieval, reasoning, translation, and document generation, delivering context-aware legal drafts, citations, and plain-language explanations via an interactive chat interface. Evaluated by law faculty from leading Bangladeshi universities across all stages of the 2022 and 2023 Bangladesh Bar Council Exams, Mina scored 75-80% in Preliminary MCQs, Written, and simulated Viva Voce exams, matching or surpassing average human performance and demonstrating clarity, contextual understanding, and sound legal reasoning. These results confirm its potential as a low-cost, multilingual AI assistant that automates key legal tasks and scales access to justice, offering a real-world case study on building domain-specific, low-resource systems and addressing challenges of multilingual adaptation, efficiency, and sustainable public-service AI deployment.

Abstract: Medical decision-support and advising systems are critical for emergency physicians to quickly and accurately assess patients' conditions and make diagnosis. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in healthcare in recent years and Large Language Models (LLMs) have been employed in various fields of medical decision-support systems. We studied responses of a group of different LLMs to real cases in emergency medicine. The results of our study on five most renown LLMs showed significant differences in capabilities of Large Language Models for diagnostics acute diseases in medical emergencies with accuracy ranging between 58% and 65%. This accuracy significantly exceeds the reported accuracy of human doctors. We built a super-learner MEDAS (Medical Emergency Diagnostic Advising System) of five major LLMs - Gemini, Llama, Grok, GPT, and Claude). The super-learner produces higher diagnostic accuracy, 70%, even with a quite basic meta-learner. However, at least one of the integrated LLMs in the same super-learner produces 85% correct diagnoses. The super-learner integrates a cluster of LLMs using a meta-learner capable of learning different capabilities of each LLM to leverage diagnostic accuracy of the model by collective capabilities of all LLMs in the cluster. The results of our study showed that aggregated diagnostic accuracy provided by a meta-learning approach exceeds that of any individual LLM, suggesting that the super-learner can take advantage of the combined knowledge of the medical datasets used to train the group of LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于梯度感知的自适应数据选择方法GrADS，通过分析初步训练阶段的梯度来识别有效的训练数据子集，仅用5%的数据就能超越全数据集微调的性能，同时显著缓解灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在许多任务上取得了显著成就，但监督微调对于适应专业领域仍然至关重要。然而，领域专业化的SFT资源密集，且由于灾难性遗忘可能导致通用能力下降。

Method: 提出GrADS方法，设计自引导标准，利用梯度的大小和统计分布来优先选择对模型学习过程贡献最大的样本，从而获取能够增强LLM对领域特定任务理解的代表性样本。

Result: 在医学、法律和金融等多个领域的各种LLM上进行广泛实验，GrADS显示出显著的效率和成本效益。仅使用5%的选定GrADS数据，LLM的性能就超过了在整个数据集上微调的模型，使用50%的数据则带来显著改进，同时灾难性遗忘得到大幅缓解。

Conclusion: GrADS是一种高效且成本效益高的方法，能够通过智能数据选择显著提升LLM在专业领域的性能，同时有效缓解灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Despite large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive achievements across numerous tasks, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) remains essential for adapting these models to specialized domains. However, SFT for domain specialization can be resource-intensive and sometimes leads to a deterioration in performance over general capabilities due to catastrophic forgetting (CF). To address these issues, we propose a self-adaptive gradient-aware data selection approach (GrADS) for supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, which identifies effective subsets of training data by analyzing gradients obtained from a preliminary training phase. Specifically, we design self-guided criteria that leverage the magnitude and statistical distribution of gradients to prioritize examples that contribute the most to the model's learning process. This approach enables the acquisition of representative samples that enhance LLMs understanding of domain-specific tasks. Through extensive experimentation with various LLMs across diverse domains such as medicine, law, and finance, GrADS has demonstrated significant efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Remarkably, utilizing merely 5% of the selected GrADS data, LLMs already surpass the performance of those fine-tuned on the entire dataset, and increasing to 50% of the data results in significant improvements! With catastrophic forgetting substantially mitigated simultaneously. We will release our code for GrADS later.

Abstract: Worldwide, suicide is the second leading cause of death for adolescents with past suicide attempts to be an important predictor for increased future suicides. While some people with suicidal thoughts may try to suppress them, many signal their intentions in social media platforms. To address these issues, we propose a new type of hybrid deep learning scheme, i.e., the combination of a CNN architecture and a BiGRU technique, which can accurately identify the patterns of suicidal ideation from SN datasets. Also, we apply Explainable AI methods using SHapley Additive exPlanations to interpret the prediction results and verifying the model reliability. This integration of CNN local feature extraction, BiGRU bidirectional sequence modeling, attention mechanisms, and SHAP interpretability provides a comprehensive framework for suicide detection. Training and evaluation of the system were performed on a publicly available dataset. Several performance metrics were used for evaluating model performance. Our method was found to have achieved 93.97 accuracy in experimental results. Comparative study to different state-of-the-art Machine Learning and DL models and existing literature demonstrates the superiority of our proposed technique over all the competing methods.

TL;DR: SAGE-Agent通过结构化不确定性建模工具调用参数，使用POMDP和EVPI目标优化问题选择，在模糊任务中提高覆盖率7-39%，同时减少澄清问题1.5-2.7倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在工具调用时，模糊的用户指令经常导致错误调用和任务失败，需要更有效的澄清机制。

Method: 引入工具调用参数的结构化不确定性建模，将联合工具参数澄清建模为具有EVPI目标的POMDP，使用基于方面的成本建模防止冗余问题。

Result: 在ClarifyBench基准测试中，SAGE-Agent在文档编辑、车辆控制和旅行预订等多样化领域表现优异；结构化不确定性还通过不确定性加权GRPO训练将When2Call准确率从36.5%提升至65.2%（3B模型）。

Conclusion: 结构化不确定性为工具增强代理提供了原则性、高效的方法，显著提高了现实场景中的任务成功率和交互效率。

Abstract: LLM agents extend large language models with tool-calling capabilities, but ambiguous user instructions often lead to incorrect invocations and task failures. We introduce a principled formulation of structured uncertainty over tool-call parameters, modeling joint tool-argument clarification as a POMDP with Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI) objective for optimal question selection and aspect-based cost modeling to prevent redundancy. Our SAGE-Agent leverages this structured uncertainty to achieve superior efficiency: increasing coverage on ambiguous tasks by 7-39\% while reducing clarification questions by 1.5-2.7$\times$ compared to strong prompting and uncertainty-based baselines. We present ClarifyBench, the first multi-turn tool-augmented disambiguation benchmark with realistic LLM-based user simulation across diverse domains including document editing, vehicle control, and travel booking. Additionally, we demonstrate that structured uncertainty provides effective training signals for reinforcement learning, boosting When2Call accuracy from 36.5\% to 65.2\% (3B model) and 36.7\% to 62.9\% (7B model) through uncertainty-weighted GRPO training. These results establish structured uncertainty as a principled, efficient approach for tool-augmented agents, improving both task success and interaction efficiency in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 本研究开发并评估了三种NLP模型，用于从帕金森病患者自述中自动识别认知过程类别。微调的Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct模型表现最佳，在复杂认知类别提取方面优于其他模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解帕金森病患者日常生活中的认知体验描述可以提供疾病相关认知和情感变化的重要见解，但从非结构化患者叙述中提取此类信息具有挑战性。

Method: 比较了三种模型：基于Bio_ClinicalBERT的嵌套实体识别模型、使用QLoRA微调的Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct指令跟随模型，以及在零样本和少样本设置下评估的GPT-4o mini模型，用于提取七个认知类别。

Result: 模型性能在不同类别和模型家族间差异显著。微调的Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct获得最高F1分数（微平均0.74，宏平均0.59），在上下文依赖类别如思维和社交互动方面表现优异。Bio_ClinicalBERT精度高但召回率低。

Conclusion: 尽管由于认知过程叙述的抽象和重叠性，该任务比传统信息提取更具挑战性，但经过持续改进，这些NLP系统有望实现低负担的认知功能纵向监测，并作为帕金森病正式神经心理学评估的有价值补充。

Abstract: Understanding how individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) describe cognitive experiences in their daily lives can offer valuable insights into disease-related cognitive and emotional changes. However, extracting such information from unstructured patient narratives is challenging due to the subtle, overlapping nature of cognitive constructs. This study developed and evaluated natural language processing (NLP) models to automatically identify categories that reflect various cognitive processes from de-identified first-person narratives. Three model families, a Bio_ClinicalBERT-based span categorization model for nested entity recognition, a fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct model using QLoRA for instruction following, and GPT-4o mini evaluated under zero- and few-shot settings, were compared on their performance on extracting seven categories. Our findings indicated that model performance varied substantially across categories and model families. The fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct achieved the highest overall F1-scores (0.74 micro-average and 0.59 macro-average), particularly excelling in context-dependent categories such as thought and social interaction. Bio_ClinicalBERT exhibited high precision but low recall and performed comparable to Llama for some category types such as location and time but failed on other categories such as thought, emotion and social interaction. Compared to conventional information extraction tasks, this task presents a greater challenge due to the abstract and overlapping nature of narrative accounts of complex cognitive processes. Nonetheless, with continued refinement, these NLP systems hold promise for enabling low-burden, longitudinal monitoring of cognitive function and serving as a valuable complement to formal neuropsychological assessments in PD.

Abstract: Despite the growing progress in Natural Language Inference (NLI) research, resources for the Bengali language remain extremely limited. Existing Bengali NLI datasets exhibit several inconsistencies, including annotation errors, ambiguous sentence pairs, and inadequate linguistic diversity, which hinder effective model training and evaluation. To address these limitations, we introduce BNLI, a refined and linguistically curated Bengali NLI dataset designed to support robust language understanding and inference modeling. The dataset was constructed through a rigorous annotation pipeline emphasizing semantic clarity and balance across entailment, contradiction, and neutrality classes. We benchmarked BNLI using a suite of state-of-the-art transformer-based architectures, including multilingual and Bengali-specific models, to assess their ability to capture complex semantic relations in Bengali text. The experimental findings highlight the improved reliability and interpretability achieved with BNLI, establishing it as a strong foundation for advancing research in Bengali and other low-resource language inference tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实对话需要任务导向和闲聊模式之间的自然切换，但现有系统通常只专注于单一模式，缺乏统一的过渡建模能力。

Method: 引入TACT数据集，支持用户和代理驱动的模式切换，提出Switch和Recovery评估指标，并应用Direct Preference Optimization进行模型训练。

Result: TACT训练的模型在意图检测和模式转换处理上优于基线，DPO进一步提升了性能，达到75.74%的联合模式-意图准确率和70.1%对GPT-4o的胜率。

Conclusion: 结构多样化的数据与DPO结合能够增强响应质量和过渡控制，为更主动和过渡感知的对话代理铺平道路。

Abstract: Conversational agents have traditionally been developed for either task-oriented dialogue (TOD) or open-ended chitchat, with limited progress in unifying the two. Yet, real-world conversations naturally involve fluid transitions between these modes. To address this gap, we introduce TACT (TOD-And-Chitchat Transition), a dataset designed for transition-aware dialogue modeling that incorporates structurally diverse and integrated mode flows. TACT supports both user- and agent-driven mode switches, enabling robust modeling of complex conversational dynamics. To evaluate an agent's ability to initiate and recover from mode transitions, we propose two new metrics -- Switch and Recovery. Models trained on TACT outperform baselines in both intent detection and mode transition handling. Moreover, applying Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to TACT-trained models yields additional gains, achieving 75.74\% joint mode-intent accuracy and a 70.1\% win rate against GPT-4o in human evaluation. These results demonstrate that pairing structurally diverse data with DPO enhances response quality and transition control, paving the way for more proactive and transition-aware conversational agents.

Motivation: 传统生物医学假设生成方法依赖单一数据类型或预定义提取模式，限制了发现新颖复杂关系的能力。LLM代理在信息检索、推理和生成方面具有潜力，但缺乏标准化数据集和执行环境。

Method: 提出BioVerge基准测试和BioVerge Agent框架，使用ReAct方法，包含生成和评估模块，迭代生成并自我评估假设提案。数据集包含历史生物医学假设和PubMed文献的结构化和文本数据。

Result: 实验发现：1）不同BioVerge Agent架构影响探索多样性和推理策略；2）结构化和文本信息源各自提供独特关键上下文；3）自我评估显著提高假设的新颖性和相关性。

Conclusion: BioVerge为生物医学假设生成提供了标准化环境，证明了LLM代理在该领域的潜力，特别是自我评估机制对提高假设质量的重要性。

Abstract: Hypothesis generation in biomedical research has traditionally centered on uncovering hidden relationships within vast scientific literature, often using methods like Literature-Based Discovery (LBD). Despite progress, current approaches typically depend on single data types or predefined extraction patterns, which restricts the discovery of novel and complex connections. Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents show significant potential, with capabilities in information retrieval, reasoning, and generation. However, their application to biomedical hypothesis generation has been limited by the absence of standardized datasets and execution environments. To address this, we introduce BioVerge, a comprehensive benchmark, and BioVerge Agent, an LLM-based agent framework, to create a standardized environment for exploring biomedical hypothesis generation at the frontier of existing scientific knowledge. Our dataset includes structured and textual data derived from historical biomedical hypotheses and PubMed literature, organized to support exploration by LLM agents. BioVerge Agent utilizes a ReAct-based approach with distinct Generation and Evaluation modules that iteratively produce and self-assess hypothesis proposals. Through extensive experimentation, we uncover key insights: 1) different architectures of BioVerge Agent influence exploration diversity and reasoning strategies; 2) structured and textual information sources each provide unique, critical contexts that enhance hypothesis generation; and 3) self-evaluation significantly improves the novelty and relevance of proposed hypotheses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在参考文献推荐中存在幻觉生成不存在论文的问题，研究假设LLMs正确生成参考文献的能力取决于知识是生成的还是记忆的，高引用论文在预训练语料中出现频率更高，幻觉率更低。

Method: 使用GPT-4.1在20个计算机科学领域生成100条参考文献，通过手动验证和计算生成与真实元数据之间的余弦相似度来测量事实一致性。

Result: 结果显示：(i)引用次数与事实准确性强相关；(ii)超过约1000次引用的参考文献信息几乎被逐字记忆；(iii)当多个高引用论文内容相似时会出现记忆干扰。

Conclusion: 研究发现了从泛化转向记忆的阈值，高度引用的论文几乎被逐字保留在模型中，这对理解LLMs的知识表示和幻觉机制具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they have also been used to assist in citation recommendation, the hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce bibliographic records depends on whether the underlying knowledge is generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear in the pretraining corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency with which a given bibliographic record appears in the pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified 100 citations across twenty computer-science domains, and measured factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic metadata. The results revealed that (i) citation count is strongly correlated with factual accuracy, (ii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatim memorized beyond roughly 1,000 citations, and (iii) memory interference occurs when multiple highly cited papers share similar content. These findings indicate a threshold where generalization shifts into memorization, with highly cited papers being nearly verbatim retained in the model.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks, yet they often produce hallucinated content that undermines factual reliability. To address this challenge, we introduce HalluClean, a lightweight and task-agnostic framework for detecting and correcting hallucinations in LLM-generated text. HalluClean adopts a reasoning-enhanced paradigm, explicitly decomposing the process into planning, execution, and revision stages to identify and refine unsupported claims. It employs minimal task-routing prompts to enable zero-shot generalization across diverse domains, without relying on external knowledge sources or supervised detectors. We conduct extensive evaluations on five representative tasks-question answering, dialogue, summarization, math word problems, and contradiction detection. Experimental results show that HalluClean significantly improves factual consistency and outperforms competitive baselines, demonstrating its potential to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM outputs in real-world applications.

TL;DR: TiDAR是一种序列级混合架构，在单个前向传播中并行使用扩散模型进行草稿生成（Thinking），然后使用自回归模型进行最终采样（Talking），实现了高吞吐量和AR级别质量的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法有效平衡扩散模型的并行生成能力和自回归模型的质量优势，要么优先考虑AR模型但草稿效率低，要么使用AR类解码逻辑但牺牲并行性和质量。

Method: TiDAR采用序列级混合架构，通过特殊设计的结构化注意力掩码，在单个前向传播中同时进行扩散草稿生成和自回归采样，充分利用GPU计算密度。

Result: 在1.5B和8B规模上，TiDAR在吞吐量上优于推测解码，在效率和质量上超越Dream和Llada等扩散模型，首次在保持AR模型质量的同时实现4.71x到5.91x的每秒token生成量提升。

Conclusion: TiDAR是首个能够缩小与AR模型质量差距，同时显著提升生成效率的架构，实现了高吞吐量、高GPU利用率和AR级别质量的协同效应。

Abstract: Diffusion language models hold the promise of fast parallel generation, while autoregressive (AR) models typically excel in quality due to their causal structure aligning naturally with language modeling. This raises a fundamental question: can we achieve a synergy with high throughput, higher GPU utilization, and AR level quality? Existing methods fail to effectively balance these two aspects, either prioritizing AR using a weaker model for sequential drafting (speculative decoding), leading to lower drafting efficiency, or using some form of left-to-right (AR-like) decoding logic for diffusion, which still suffers from quality degradation and forfeits its potential parallelizability. We introduce TiDAR, a sequence-level hybrid architecture that drafts tokens (Thinking) in Diffusion and samples final outputs (Talking) AutoRegressively - all within a single forward pass using specially designed structured attention masks. This design exploits the free GPU compute density, achieving a strong balance between drafting and verification capacity. Moreover, TiDAR is designed to be serving-friendly (low overhead) as a standalone model. We extensively evaluate TiDAR against AR models, speculative decoding, and diffusion variants across generative and likelihood tasks at 1.5B and 8B scales. Thanks to the parallel drafting and sampling as well as exact KV cache support, TiDAR outperforms speculative decoding in measured throughput and surpasses diffusion models like Dream and Llada in both efficiency and quality. Most notably, TiDAR is the first architecture to close the quality gap with AR models while delivering 4.71x to 5.91x more tokens per second.

TL;DR: EVADE框架使用大语言模型生成和验证解释来检测自然语言推理任务中的标注错误，相比传统人工标注方法更高效且能提升数据集质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自然语言推理等任务中，人类标注变异现象使得难以区分标注错误和合理的标签变化。传统VARIERR框架需要两轮人工标注，成本高昂且可能限制合理标签或解释的覆盖范围。

Method: 提出EVADE框架，利用大语言模型生成和验证解释来检测错误。通过比较人类和LLM检测到的错误，分析分布比较、验证重叠以及对模型微调的影响。

Result: LLM验证能够优化生成的解释分布，使其更接近人类标注。从训练数据中移除LLM检测到的错误比移除人工标注识别的错误更能提升微调性能。

Conclusion: EVADE框架展示了在标签变异情况下扩展错误检测的潜力，能够减少人工工作量同时提升数据集质量。

Abstract: High-quality datasets are critical for training and evaluating reliable NLP models. In tasks like natural language inference (NLI), human label variation (HLV) arises when multiple labels are valid for the same instance, making it difficult to separate annotation errors from plausible variation. An earlier framework VARIERR (Weber-Genzel et al., 2024) asks multiple annotators to explain their label decisions in the first round and flag errors via validity judgments in the second round. However, conducting two rounds of manual annotation is costly and may limit the coverage of plausible labels or explanations. Our study proposes a new framework, EVADE, for generating and validating explanations to detect errors using large language models (LLMs). We perform a comprehensive analysis comparing human- and LLM-detected errors for NLI across distribution comparison, validation overlap, and impact on model fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM validation refines generated explanation distributions to more closely align with human annotations, and that removing LLM-detected errors from training data yields improvements in fine-tuning performance than removing errors identified by human annotators. This highlights the potential to scale error detection, reducing human effort while improving dataset quality under label variation.

Motivation: 现有潜在推理方法缺乏确保潜在表示稳定演化的机制，也没有系统的方法来交织隐式和显式推理。

Method: 引入SpiralThinker框架，在潜在表示上执行迭代更新，实现扩展的隐式推理而不生成额外token。使用渐进对齐目标和结构化标注来维持潜在推理与文本推理之间的一致性。

Result: 在数学、逻辑和常识推理任务中，SpiralThinker在潜在推理方法中取得了最佳整体性能，在所有基准测试中一致超越先前方法。

Conclusion: SpiralThinker将迭代计算与潜在推理相结合，证明对齐的迭代更新可以在潜在空间中可靠地引导推理过程。

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have been driven by reinforcement learning and test-time scaling, accompanied by growing interest in latent rather than purely textual reasoning. However, existing latent reasoning methods lack mechanisms to ensure stable evolution of latent representations and a systematic way to interleave implicit and explicit reasoning. We introduce SpiralThinker, a unified framework that performs iterative updates over latent representations, enabling extended implicit reasoning without generating additional tokens. A progressive alignment objective combined with structured annotations maintains coherence between latent and textual reasoning. Across mathematical, logical, and commonsense reasoning tasks, SpiralThinker achieves the best overall performance among latent reasoning approaches, consistently surpassing previous methods across all benchmarks. Detailed analyses reveal that both iteration and alignment are indispensable, the numbers of latent tokens and iterations exhibit dataset-specific optima, and appropriate alignment proves critical for an effective iterative process. Overall, SpiralThinker bridges iterative computation and latent reasoning, demonstrating that aligned iterative updates can reliably steer reasoning in the latent space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM情感支持评估主要依赖短对话和静态快照，无法捕捉情感支持的动态性和长期性，需要更真实的评估方法。

Method: 构建大规模基准测试，约束模型使用验证的情绪调节策略，将用户情感轨迹建模为一阶马尔可夫过程，并应用因果调整的情感估计来无偏追踪情感状态。

Result: 引入三个轨迹级指标（BEL、ETV、ECP）来捕捉用户情感动态，评估发现不同LLMs在情感支持能力上存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLMs的长期情感支持性能提供了全面评估，并为模型开发提供了可操作的见解。

Abstract: Emotional support is a core capability in human-AI interaction, with applications including psychological counseling, role play, and companionship. However, existing evaluations of large language models (LLMs) often rely on short, static dialogues and fail to capture the dynamic and long-term nature of emotional support. To overcome this limitation, we shift from snapshot-based evaluation to trajectory-based assessment, adopting a user-centered perspective that evaluates models based on their ability to improve and stabilize user emotional states over time. Our framework constructs a large-scale benchmark consisting of 328 emotional contexts and 1,152 disturbance events, simulating realistic emotional shifts under evolving dialogue scenarios. To encourage psychologically grounded responses, we constrain model outputs using validated emotion regulation strategies such as situation selection and cognitive reappraisal. User emotional trajectories are modeled as a first-order Markov process, and we apply causally-adjusted emotion estimation to obtain unbiased emotional state tracking. Based on this framework, we introduce three trajectory-level metrics: Baseline Emotional Level (BEL), Emotional Trajectory Volatility (ETV), and Emotional Centroid Position (ECP). These metrics collectively capture user emotional dynamics over time and support comprehensive evaluation of long-term emotional support performance of LLMs. Extensive evaluations across a diverse set of LLMs reveal significant disparities in emotional support capabilities and provide actionable insights for model development.

TL;DR: 提出了一个两阶段神经符号框架，使用LLM将自然语言政策形式化，并通过推理时自动形式化验证逻辑正确性，在严格监管行业中实现超过99%的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在自然语言理解和推理方面表现良好，但其固有的随机性限制了在金融、医疗等受严格政策监管的行业中的应用。

Method: 两阶段神经符号框架：第一阶段使用LLM（可选人工指导）将自然语言政策形式化；第二阶段在推理时进行自动形式化，验证自然语言陈述相对于这些政策的逻辑正确性。当正确性至关重要时，执行多个冗余形式化步骤并进行语义等价性交叉检查。

Result: 基准测试表明该方法超过99%的可靠性，表明在识别逻辑有效性方面接近零的误报率。

Conclusion: 该方法产生可审计的逻辑工件，能够验证结果并为改进原始文本提供依据，为受监管行业提供了可靠的政策验证解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models perform well at natural language interpretation and reasoning, but their inherent stochasticity limits their adoption in regulated industries like finance and healthcare that operate under strict policies. To address this limitation, we present a two-stage neurosymbolic framework that (1) uses LLMs with optional human guidance to formalize natural language policies, allowing fine-grained control of the formalization process, and (2) uses inference-time autoformalization to validate logical correctness of natural language statements against those policies. When correctness is paramount, we perform multiple redundant formalization steps at inference time, cross checking the formalizations for semantic equivalence. Our benchmarks demonstrate that our approach exceeds 99% soundness, indicating a near-zero false positive rate in identifying logical validity. Our approach produces auditable logical artifacts that substantiate the verification outcomes and can be used to improve the original text.

Abstract: The ability of critique is vital for models to self-improve and serve as reliable AI assistants. While extensively studied in language-only settings, multimodal critique of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) remains underexplored despite their growing capabilities in tasks like captioning and visual reasoning. In this work, we introduce MM-CRITIC, a holistic benchmark for evaluating the critique ability of LMMs across multiple dimensions: basic, correction, and comparison. Covering 8 main task types and over 500 tasks, MM-CRITIC collects responses from various LMMs with different model sizes and is composed of 4471 samples. To enhance the evaluation reliability, we integrate expert-informed ground answers into scoring rubrics that guide GPT-4o in annotating responses and generating reference critiques, which serve as anchors for trustworthy judgments. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of MM-CRITIC and provide a comprehensive assessment of leading LMMs' critique capabilities under multiple dimensions. Further analysis reveals some key insights, including the correlation between response quality and critique, and varying critique difficulty across evaluation dimensions.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于混合CTC/注意力架构的安多藏语流式语音识别框架，采用上下文感知动态分块机制，通过自适应调整块宽度来解决固定分块方法的上下文截断问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决安多藏语语音识别中固定分块方法导致的上下文截断问题，并更好地捕捉藏语的语言学特征。

Method: 使用混合CTC/注意力架构，结合上下文感知动态分块机制，构建基于藏语正字法原则的词典，并在解码时集成外部语言模型。

Result: 在测试集上达到6.23%的词错误率，相比固定分块基线相对提升48.15%，显著降低识别延迟且性能接近全局解码。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架有效解决了流式语音识别中的上下文截断问题，在安多藏语识别任务中取得了显著性能提升，同时保持了低延迟。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a streaming speech recognition framework for Amdo Tibetan, built upon a hybrid CTC/Atten-tion architecture with a context-aware dynamic chunking mechanism. The proposed strategy adaptively adjusts chunk widths based on encoding states, enabling flexible receptive fields, cross-chunk information exchange, and robust adaptation to varying speaking rates, thereby alleviating the context truncation problem of fixed-chunk methods. To further capture the linguistic characteristics of Tibetan, we construct a lexicon grounded in its orthographic principles, providing linguistically motivated modeling units. During decoding, an external language model is integrated to enhance semantic consistency and improve recognition of long sentences. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves a word error rate (WER) of 6.23% on the test set, yielding a 48.15% relative improvement over the fixed-chunk baseline, while significantly reducing recognition latency and maintaining performance close to global decoding.

*Ritsu Sakabe,Hwichan Kim,Tosho Hirasawa,Mamoru Komachi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过日本即兴喜剧游戏Oogiri系统评估大语言模型的幽默能力，发现LLMs在生成幽默回复方面达到中低水平人类表现，但缺乏共情能力，且评估标准与人类存在根本差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要依赖单维度评估（如是否"有趣"），而幽默需要多维度理解。本文旨在通过Oogiri游戏系统评估LLMs的幽默能力，填补多维度幽默评估的空白。

Method: 扩展现有Oogiri数据集，用LLMs生成回复，并手动标注6个维度的5点评分：新颖性、清晰度、相关性、智能性、共情性和整体趣味性。评估LLMs在生成和评估两个核心任务上的表现。

Result: LLMs能生成中低水平人类表现的幽默回复，但显著缺乏共情能力。相关分析显示LLMs与人类评估标准存在根本分歧：LLMs优先考虑新颖性，而人类优先考虑共情性。

Conclusion: LLMs在幽默生成和评估方面存在共情缺陷，这限制了其复制人类幽默评估的能力。发布标注语料库以促进更情感智能的对话代理开发。

Abstract: Computational humor is a frontier for creating advanced and engaging natural language processing (NLP) applications, such as sophisticated dialogue systems. While previous studies have benchmarked the humor capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), they have often relied on single-dimensional evaluations, such as judging whether something is simply ``funny.'' This paper argues that a multifaceted understanding of humor is necessary and addresses this gap by systematically evaluating LLMs through the lens of Oogiri, a form of Japanese improvisational comedy games. To achieve this, we expanded upon existing Oogiri datasets with data from new sources and then augmented the collection with Oogiri responses generated by LLMs. We then manually annotated this expanded collection with 5-point absolute ratings across six dimensions: Novelty, Clarity, Relevance, Intelligence, Empathy, and Overall Funniness. Using this dataset, we assessed the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs on two core tasks: their ability to generate creative Oogiri responses and their ability to evaluate the funniness of responses using a six-dimensional evaluation. Our results show that while LLMs can generate responses at a level between low- and mid-tier human performance, they exhibit a notable lack of Empathy. This deficit in Empathy helps explain their failure to replicate human humor assessment. Correlation analyses of human and model evaluation data further reveal a fundamental divergence in evaluation criteria: LLMs prioritize Novelty, whereas humans prioritize Empathy. We release our annotated corpus to the community to pave the way for the development of more emotionally intelligent and sophisticated conversational agents.

Motivation: EFL教育中个性化学习日益重要，学生的参与度和动机对阅读理解至关重要，但现有材料缺乏个性化适配，难以激发学生兴趣。

Method: 开发结构化内容转创流程：从RACE-C数据集出发，使用GPT-4o生成语言特征相似但语义与个人兴趣对齐的新文章和选择题；集成主题提取、布鲁姆分类法问题分类、语言特征分析和内容转创。

Result: 在韩国EFL学习者中的对照实验显示，使用个性化阅读材料的学生在理解能力和动机保持方面均优于使用非个性化材料的学生。

Conclusion: 兴趣对齐的个性化阅读材料能有效提升EFL学习者的阅读理解表现和学习动机，证明了基于AI的内容转创在个性化教育中的实用价值。

Abstract: Personalized learning has gained attention in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) education, where engagement and motivation play crucial roles in reading comprehension. We propose a novel approach to generating personalized English reading comprehension tests tailored to students' interests. We develop a structured content transcreation pipeline using OpenAI's gpt-4o, where we start with the RACE-C dataset, and generate new passages and multiple-choice reading comprehension questions that are linguistically similar to the original passages but semantically aligned with individual learners' interests. Our methodology integrates topic extraction, question classification based on Bloom's taxonomy, linguistic feature analysis, and content transcreation to enhance student engagement. We conduct a controlled experiment with EFL learners in South Korea to examine the impact of interest-aligned reading materials on comprehension and motivation. Our results show students learning with personalized reading passages demonstrate improved comprehension and motivation retention compared to those learning with non-personalized materials.

TL;DR: DoPE是一种无需训练的方法，通过检测位置编码特征图中的异常频率带并重新参数化，显著改善了Transformer模型在长序列上的外推能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RoPE位置编码存在限制，会削弱长度外推能力，导致注意力下沉现象，影响模型在长上下文中的表现。

Method: 将带位置编码的注意力图重新解释为噪声特征图，基于截断矩阵熵检测异常频率带，并使用无参数高斯分布重新参数化特征图。

Result: 在needle-in-a-haystack和many-shot in-context learning任务中，DoPE在长达64K token的扩展上下文中显著提高了检索准确性和推理稳定性。

Conclusion: 位置编码的去噪策略有效缓解了注意力下沉现象，恢复了平衡的注意力模式，为改进长度泛化提供了简单而强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) in Transformer models has inherent limits that weaken length extrapolation. We reinterpret the attention map with positional encoding as a noisy feature map, and propose Denoising Positional Encoding (DoPE), a training-free method based on truncated matrix entropy to detect outlier frequency bands in the feature map. Leveraging the noise characteristics of the feature map, we further reparameterize it with a parameter-free Gaussian distribution to achieve robust extrapolation. Our method theoretically reveals the underlying cause of the attention sink phenomenon and its connection to truncated matrix entropy. Experiments on needle-in-a-haystack and many-shot in-context learning tasks demonstrate that DoPE significantly improves retrieval accuracy and reasoning stability across extended contexts (up to 64K tokens). The results show that the denoising strategy for positional embeddings effectively mitigates attention sinks and restores balanced attention patterns, providing a simple yet powerful solution for improving length generalization.

TL;DR: LoopTool是一个完全自动化的模型感知数据进化框架，通过紧密集成数据合成和模型训练，迭代优化数据和模型，显著提升LLM的工具使用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具学习采用静态合成数据管道，数据生成和模型训练分离，无法自适应关注模型特定弱点，且噪声标签持续存在，降低了训练效率。

Method: LoopTool包含三个协同模块：贪婪能力探测诊断模型掌握和失败的能力；判断引导标签验证使用开源判断模型查找纠正标注错误；错误驱动数据扩展基于识别失败生成新挑战样本。

Result: 使用LoopTool训练的8B模型显著超越其32B数据生成器，在BFCL-v3和ACEBench基准测试中达到其规模的最新最先进结果。

Conclusion: 闭环自精炼数据管道可以显著增强LLM的工具使用能力，且该框架在成本效益高的开源生态系统中运行，消除了对昂贵闭源API的依赖。

Abstract: Augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools enables them to execute complex, multi-step tasks. However, tool learning is hampered by the static synthetic data pipelines where data generation and model training are executed as two separate, non-interactive processes. This approach fails to adaptively focus on a model's specific weaknesses and allows noisy labels to persist, degrading training efficiency. We introduce LoopTool, a fully automated, model-aware data evolution framework that closes this loop by tightly integrating data synthesis and model training. LoopTool iteratively refines both the data and the model through three synergistic modules: (1) Greedy Capability Probing (GCP) diagnoses the model's mastered and failed capabilities; (2) Judgement-Guided Label Verification (JGLV) uses an open-source judge model to find and correct annotation errors, progressively purifying the dataset; and (3) Error-Driven Data Expansion (EDDE) generates new, challenging samples based on identified failures. This closed-loop process operates within a cost-effective, open-source ecosystem, eliminating dependence on expensive closed-source APIs. Experiments show that our 8B model trained with LoopTool significantly surpasses its 32B data generator and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the BFCL-v3 and ACEBench benchmarks for its scale. Our work demonstrates that closed-loop, self-refining data pipelines can dramatically enhance the tool-use capabilities of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在表格问答中直接输入整个表格作为长文本往往导致错误答案，因为大多数LLM无法固有地捕捉复杂的表格结构。

Method: 使用语言模型和TF-IDF的混合检索机制计算给定问题与单个单元格的相似度来估计表头，然后选择最相关行和列交集的单元格作为答案。语言模型使用对比学习在小数据集上进行训练。

Result: 在NTCIR-18 U4共享任务的TQA数据集上评估，该方法达到了74.6%的准确率，优于GPT-4o mini等现有LLM（63.9%）。

Conclusion: 虽然本研究使用了传统的编码器模型进行检索，但计划整合更高效的文本搜索模型来提升性能，缩小与人工评估结果的差距。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining increased attention in the domain of Table Question Answering (TQA), particularly for extracting information from tables in documents. However, directly entering entire tables as long text into LLMs often leads to incorrect answers because most LLMs cannot inherently capture complex table structures. In this paper, we propose a cell extraction method for TQA without manual identification, even for complex table headers. Our approach estimates table headers by computing similarities between a given question and individual cells via a hybrid retrieval mechanism that integrates a language model and TF-IDF. We then select as the answer the cells at the intersection of the most relevant row and column. Furthermore, the language model is trained using contrastive learning on a small dataset of question-header pairs to enhance performance. We evaluated our approach in the TQA dataset from the U4 shared task at NTCIR-18. The experimental results show that our pipeline achieves an accuracy of 74.6\%, outperforming existing LLMs such as GPT-4o mini~(63.9\%). In the future, although we used traditional encoder models for retrieval in this study, we plan to incorporate more efficient text-search models to improve performance and narrow the gap with human evaluation results.

TL;DR: 本文通过实证验证了基于上下文的sequentiality度量在自动作文评分中的有效性，发现它比原始sequentiality和仅基于主题的版本更能反映人类对篇章级特征（如组织和连贯性）的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究提出使用LLMs量化叙事流畅度，但存在主题选择混淆和缺乏真实流畅度验证的问题。有批评建议仅使用上下文术语作为更概念有效和可解释的替代方案。

Method: 使用两个带有人工标注特征分数的作文数据集（ASAP++和ELLIPSE），比较不同版本的sequentiality度量与人类评估的一致性，并分析其与标准语言特征结合时的预测价值。

Result: 基于上下文的sequentiality版本与人类对组织和连贯性等篇章级特征的评估更一致。虽然零样本提示的LLMs在预测特征分数方面更准确，但上下文度量与标准语言特征结合时比仅基于主题和原始sequentiality公式增加了更多预测价值，甚至超过了零样本LLM预测。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持使用基于上下文的sequentiality作为经过验证、可解释且互补的特征，用于自动作文评分和相关NLP任务，突显了显式建模句子间流畅度的价值。

Abstract: Recent work has proposed using Large Language Models (LLMs) to quantify narrative flow through a measure called sequentiality, which combines topic and contextual terms. A recent critique argued that the original results were confounded by how topics were selected for the topic-based component, and noted that the metric had not been validated against ground-truth measures of flow. That work proposed using only the contextual term as a more conceptually valid and interpretable alternative. In this paper, we empirically validate that proposal. Using two essay datasets with human-annotated trait scores, ASAP++ and ELLIPSE, we show that the contextual version of sequentiality aligns more closely with human assessments of discourse-level traits such as Organization and Cohesion. While zero-shot prompted LLMs predict trait scores more accurately than the contextual measure alone, the contextual measure adds more predictive value than both the topic-only and original sequentiality formulations when combined with standard linguistic features. Notably, this combination also outperforms the zero-shot LLM predictions, highlighting the value of explicitly modeling sentence-to-sentence flow. Our findings support the use of context-based sequentiality as a validated, interpretable, and complementary feature for automated essay scoring and related NLP tasks.

Motivation: 传统子词分割通常在预处理阶段固定，但本文探索在训练过程中动态优化子词分割，以研究语言模型如何动态优化分词及其演化过程。

Method: 扩展子词分段语言模型(SSLM)框架，支持预训练和微调，针对三种类型学不同的语言(isi-Xhosa、Setswana、英语)进行训练，从语言学角度分析子词动态。

Result: 识别出子词学习的四个阶段，形态复杂的isi-Xhosa表现出更大的不稳定性；微调时子词边界变得更细粒度；可学习子词能改善低资源形态复杂语言的文本生成和跨语言迁移。

Conclusion: 可学习子词分割为低资源、形态复杂语言提供了有前景的改进方法，子词学习具有明确的动态模式，微调会促使更细粒度的分词。

Abstract: Subword segmentation is typically applied in preprocessing and stays fixed during training. Alternatively, it can be learned during training to optimise the training objective. In this paper we study the learning dynamics of subword segmentation: if a language model can dynamically optimise tokenisation, how do its subwords evolve during pretraining and finetuning? To explore this, we extend the subword segmental language model (SSLM), a framework for learning subwords during training, to support pretraining and finetuning. We train models for three typologically diverse languages to study learning dynamics across the morphological spectrum: Isi-Xhosa is conjunctive (long word forms composed of many morphemes), Setswana is disjunctive (morphemes written as separate words), and English represents a typological middle ground. We analyse subword dynamics from a linguistic perspective, tracking morphology, productivity, and fertility. We identify four stages of subword learning, with the morphologically complex isi-Xhosa exhibiting greater instability. During finetuning, subword boundaries shift to become finer-grained. Lastly, we show that learnable subwords offers a promising approach to improve text generation and cross-lingual transfer for low-resource, morphologically complex languages.

Motivation: 现有的可验证奖励强化学习(RLVR)方法主要优化最终任务结果，当早期训练中负奖励占主导时模型容易崩溃。这在诚实对齐任务中尤为突出，模型不仅要解决可回答的查询，还要识别何时无法从给定前提得出结论。

Method: 1) 从图结构中策划两个多步演绎推理数据集（线性代数和逻辑推理）；2) 通过随机扰动边引入不可回答案例；3) 提出Anchor方法，在rollout过程中注入真实轨迹以防止早期训练崩溃。

Result: 实验表明：GRPO方法（无论有无监督微调初始化）在这些任务上表现不佳；课程学习有一定帮助但需要精心设计的分布内数据集；Anchor方法能稳定学习过程并显著提高整体推理性能。

Conclusion: 训练动态对于在已对齐语言模型中实现可靠的演绎推理至关重要，Anchor方法通过注入真实轨迹有效解决了早期训练崩溃问题，为诚实对齐提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a promising framework for aligning language models with complex reasoning objectives. However, most existing methods optimize only for final task outcomes, leaving models vulnerable to collapse when negative rewards dominate early training. This challenge is especially pronounced in honesty alignment, where models must not only solve answerable queries but also identify when conclusions cannot be drawn from the given premises. Deductive reasoning provides an ideal testbed because it isolates reasoning capability from reliance on external factual knowledge. To investigate honesty alignment, we curate two multi-step deductive reasoning datasets from graph structures, one for linear algebra and one for logical inference, and introduce unanswerable cases by randomly perturbing an edge in half of the instances. We find that GRPO, with or without supervised fine tuning initialization, struggles on these tasks. Through extensive experiments across three models, we evaluate stabilization strategies and show that curriculum learning provides some benefit but requires carefully designed in distribution datasets with controllable difficulty. To address these limitations, we propose Anchor, a reinforcement learning method that injects ground truth trajectories into rollouts, preventing early training collapse. Our results demonstrate that this method stabilizes learning and significantly improves the overall reasoning performance, underscoring the importance of training dynamics for enabling reliable deductive reasoning in aligned language models.

Motivation: 现有语音大语言模型在多语言语音翻译中忽略了跨语言语义共性，导致翻译性能偏差，特别是高低资源语言间存在较大差距。

Method: 提出POTSA框架：1）偏置补偿模块粗粒度对齐语音表示；2）在Q-Former上施加token级最优传输约束建立细粒度表示一致性；3）层调度策略聚焦最优传输约束到语义最有益层。

Conclusion: POTSA通过最优传输和跨语言语义对齐，有效缩小高低资源语言翻译差距，为多语言语音翻译提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have achieved breakthroughs in multilingual speech-to-text translation (S2TT). However, existing approaches often overlook semantic commonalities across source languages, leading to biased translation performance. In this work, we propose \textbf{POTSA} (Parallel Optimal Transport for Speech Alignment), a new framework based on cross-lingual parallel speech pairs and Optimal Transport (OT), designed to bridge high- and low-resource translation gaps. First, we introduce a Bias Compensation module to coarsely align initial speech representations across languages. Second, we impose token-level OT constraints on a Q-Former using parallel speech pairs to establish fine-grained consistency of representations. Then, we apply a layer scheduling strategy to focus OT constraints on the most semantically beneficial layers. Experiments on the FLEURS dataset show that our method achieves SOTA performance, with +0.93 BLEU on average over five common languages and +5.05 BLEU on zero-shot languages, using only 10 hours of parallel speech per source language.

Result: C³TG在多个指标上显著优于基线方法，包括属性准确性、语言流畅性和输出多样性，同时降低毒性。

Conclusion: C³TG是一种无需昂贵模型修改的有效灵活的多维文本属性控制解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable text generation capabilities. However, controlling specific attributes of generated text remains challenging without architectural modifications or extensive fine-tuning. Current methods typically toggle a single, basic attribute but struggle with precise multi-attribute control. In scenarios where attribute requirements conflict, existing methods lack coordination mechanisms, causing interference between desired attributes. Furthermore, these methods fail to incorporate iterative optimization processes in the controlled generation pipeline. To address these limitations, we propose Conflict-aware, Composite, and Collaborative Controlled Text Generation (C$^3$TG), a two-phase framework for fine-grained, multi-dimensional text attribute control. During generation, C$^3$TG selectively pairs the LLM with the required attribute classifiers from the 17 available dimensions and employs weighted KL-divergence to adjust token probabilities. The optimization phase then leverages an energy function combining classifier scores and penalty terms to resolve attribute conflicts through iterative feedback, enabling precise control over multiple dimensions simultaneously while preserving natural text flow. Experiments show that C$^3$TG significantly outperforms baselines across multiple metrics including attribute accuracy, linguistic fluency, and output diversity, while simultaneously reducing toxicity. These results establish C$^3$TG as an effective and flexible solution for multi-dimensional text attribute control that requires no costly model modifications.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了LiteraryTaste数据集，用于开发个性化创意写作大语言模型，发现人们创意写作偏好存在差异，微调transformer编码器可有效建模个人和集体偏好，但自述偏好对建模实际偏好的效用有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人们有不同的创意写作偏好，但现有大语言模型通常将不同个人品味视为整体进行训练，需要适应每个用户的偏好来提升个性化创意写作能力。

Method: 构建LiteraryTaste数据集，包含60人的阅读偏好数据，包括自述偏好和100对短创意写作文本的偏好标注；使用transformer编码器进行微调建模偏好；采用LLM驱动的可解释性管道分析偏好差异。

Result: 1) 人们在创意写作偏好上存在分歧；2) 微调transformer编码器在建模个人和集体实际偏好时分别达到75.8%和67.7%的准确率；3) 自述偏好在建模实际偏好方面效用有限。

Conclusion: 该工作为个性化创意写作技术奠定了基础，展示了通过数据集和建模方法可以有效捕捉和适应个人创意写作偏好。

Abstract: People have different creative writing preferences, and large language models (LLMs) for these tasks can benefit from adapting to each user's preferences. However, these models are often trained over a dataset that considers varying personal tastes as a monolith. To facilitate developing personalized creative writing LLMs, we introduce LiteraryTaste, a dataset of reading preferences from 60 people, where each person: 1) self-reported their reading habits and tastes (stated preference), and 2) annotated their preferences over 100 pairs of short creative writing texts (revealed preference). With our dataset, we found that: 1) people diverge on creative writing preferences, 2) finetuning a transformer encoder could achieve 75.8% and 67.7% accuracy when modeling personal and collective revealed preferences, and 3) stated preferences had limited utility in modeling revealed preferences. With an LLM-driven interpretability pipeline, we analyzed how people's preferences vary. We hope our work serves as a cornerstone for personalizing creative writing technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高棉语模型通常只预测标签而不解释预测依据，缺乏可解释性。

Method: 通过微调基于指令的推理Qwen-3模型，实现可解释的高棉语极性分类，解释方式限于模型自我解释其预测理由。

Result: 实验结果显示微调后的模型不仅能准确预测标签，还能通过识别极性相关关键词或短语来支持其预测。

Conclusion: 成功开发了可解释的高棉语极性分类器，并公开了新的高棉语极性数据集和微调模型。

Abstract: Khmer polarity classification is a fundamental natural language processing task that assigns a positive, negative, or neutral label to a given Khmer text input. Existing Khmer models typically predict the label without explaining the rationale behind the prediction. This paper proposes an explainable Khmer polarity classifier by fine-tuning an instruction-based reasoning Qwen-3 model. The notion of explainability in this paper is limited to self-explanations, which the model uses to rationalize its predictions. Experimental results show that the fine-tuned model not only predicts labels accurately but also provides reasoning by identifying polarity-related keywords or phrases to support its predictions. In addition, we contribute a new Khmer polarity dataset consisting of short- to medium-length casual, romanized, and mixed-code Khmer expressions. This dataset was constructed using both heuristic rules and human curation and is publicly available through a gated Hugging Face repository (rinabuoy/khmerpolarity_nonreasoning). The fine-tuned Qwen-3 models are also made available in the same Hugging Face account.

TL;DR: 提出了AdaptDel方法，通过动态调整删除率来改进序列分类的认证鲁棒性，针对编辑距离扰动，在自然语言处理任务中取得了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用固定删除率处理不同长度的序列输入（如自然语言句子），导致性能不理想，需要适应不同输入特性的可变删除率方法。

Method: 引入AdaptDel方法，采用可适应删除率，基于输入特性动态调整删除率，并将随机平滑理论框架扩展到可变率删除，确保对编辑距离的可靠认证。

Result: 在自然语言任务中取得了强大的实证结果，与最先进的认证方法相比，认证区域的中值基数提高了高达30个数量级。

Conclusion: AdaptDel方法通过动态调整删除率有效解决了序列分类中编辑距离扰动的认证鲁棒性问题，在理论和实证层面都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We consider the problem of certified robustness for sequence classification against edit distance perturbations. Naturally occurring inputs of varying lengths (e.g., sentences in natural language processing tasks) present a challenge to current methods that employ fixed-rate deletion mechanisms and lead to suboptimal performance. To this end, we introduce AdaptDel methods with adaptable deletion rates that dynamically adjust based on input properties. We extend the theoretical framework of randomized smoothing to variable-rate deletion, ensuring sound certification with respect to edit distance. We achieve strong empirical results in natural language tasks, observing up to 30 orders of magnitude improvement to median cardinality of the certified region, over state-of-the-art certifications.

*Arka Mukherjee,Shreya Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: mmJEE-Eval是一个多模态双语基准测试，基于印度JEE高级考试题目，用于评估视觉语言模型的科学推理能力，揭示了前沿模型与开源模型之间的显著性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态推理基准测试无法有效区分真正的科学推理能力与模式匹配，需要更具挑战性的基准来评估模型的真实推理能力。

Method: 构建了包含1,460道英语和印地语双语题目的mmJEE-Eval基准，涵盖物理、化学和数学领域，评估了17个最先进模型。

Result: 前沿VLM模型在2025年题目上达到77-84%准确率，而开源模型仅为37-45%，尽管参数规模达到400B。封闭模型在增加元认知推理负载时表现崩溃（GPT-5仅修正5.2%错误）。

Conclusion: mmJEE-Eval能够有效区分训练和推理方法的优劣，其难度源于复杂性和推理深度而非记忆，为评估科学推理能力提供了更好的基准。

Abstract: Contemporary vision-language models (VLMs) perform well on existing multimodal reasoning benchmarks (78-85\% accuracy on MMMU, MathVista). Yet, these results fail to sufficiently distinguish true scientific reasoning articulation capabilities from pattern-matching. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{mmJEE-Eval}, a multimodal bilingual (English and Hindi) benchmark comprising 1,460 questions from India's JEE Advanced examination (2019-2025) spanning pre-college Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics domains. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art models reveals that while frontier VLMs (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash) achieve 77-84\% accuracy on held-out 2025 questions, open-source models plateau at 37-45\% despite scaling to 400B parameters, a significant difference not observed on existing benchmarks. While closed frontiers from Google and OpenAI show high problem-solving accuracies (up to 100\% pass@3 scores), they fully collapse when the reasoning load is increased meta-cognitively (GPT-5 fixes just 5.2\% errors). Systematic ablations show mmJEE-Eval's difficulty stems from complexity and reasoning depth rather than memorization. Effectively, our benchmark segregates superior training and reasoning methodologies where alternatives fail. We publicly release our code and data: https://mmjee-eval.github.io

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SeerSC是一个动态自一致性框架，通过整合System 1和System 2推理，同时提高令牌效率和降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时缩放虽然能提升大语言模型的推理性能，但会带来显著的计算成本。现有动态自一致性方法虽然减少了令牌消耗，但仍受限于顺序请求的高延迟。

Method: 利用快速的System 1计算给定查询的答案熵，评估样本的缩放潜力，在System 2下实现动态自一致性。通过System 1的先进准确估计，实现并行生成以减少令牌使用和延迟。

Result: 该方法优于现有方法，令牌消耗减少高达47%，推理延迟减少43%，且无显著性能损失。

Conclusion: SeerSC框架通过整合System 1和System 2推理，在保持性能的同时显著提高了令牌效率和推理速度。

Abstract: Test-time scaling improves the inference performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) but also incurs substantial computational costs. Although recent studies have reduced token consumption through dynamic self-consistency, they remain constrained by the high latency of sequential requests. In this paper, we propose SeerSC, a dynamic self-consistency framework that simultaneously improves token efficiency and latency by integrating System 1 and System 2 reasoning. Specifically, we utilize the rapid System 1 to compute the answer entropy for given queries. This score is then used to evaluate the potential of samples for scaling, enabling dynamic self-consistency under System 2. Benefiting from the advance and accurate estimation provided by System 1, the proposed method can reduce token usage while simultaneously achieving a significant decrease in latency through parallel generation. It outperforms existing methods, achieving up to a 47% reduction in token consumption and a 43% reduction in inference latency without significant performance loss.

TL;DR: 提出了Spider4SSC数据集和S2CLite解析工具，这是一个轻量级的、基于规则的SPARQL到Cypher查询转换器，无需RDF图或外部工具支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SPARQL到Cypher转换解决方案存在局限性，需要依赖RDF图或外部工具，且解析准确率较低。

Method: S2CLite采用纯基于规则的方法（受传统编程语言编译器启发），将SPARQL查询转换为Cypher查询，支持原位和大规模转换。

Result: 在Spider4SPARQL数据集上，S2CLite的解析准确率达到77.8%，显著优于现有最佳方法S2CTrans的44.2%。在执行准确率方面，S2CLite达到96.6%，比S2CTrans高出7.3%。

Conclusion: S2CLite是一个高效、准确的SPARQL到Cypher转换工具，同时生成了统一的文本到查询语言数据集Spider4SSC，为多语言查询转换研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: We present Spider4SSC dataset and S2CLite parsing tool. S2CLite is a lightweight, ontology-agnostic parser that translates SPARQL queries into Cypher queries, enabling both in-situ and large-scale SPARQL to Cypher translation. Unlike existing solutions, S2CLite is purely rule-based (inspired by traditional programming language compilers) and operates without requiring an RDF graph or external tools. Experiments conducted on the BSBM42 and Spider4SPARQL datasets show that S2CLite significantly reduces query parsing errors, achieving a total parsing accuracy of 77.8% on Spider4SPARQL compared to 44.2% by the state-of-the-art S2CTrans. Furthermore, S2CLite achieved a 96.6\% execution accuracy on the intersecting subset of queries parsed by both parsers, outperforming S2CTrans by 7.3%. We further use S2CLite to parse Spider4SPARQL queries to Cypher and generate Spider4SSC, a unified Text-to-Query language (SQL, SPARQL, Cypher) dataset with 4525 unique questions and 3 equivalent sets of 2581 matching queries (SQL, SPARQL and Cypher). We open-source S2CLite for further development on GitHub (github.com/vejvarm/S2CLite) and provide the clean Spider4SSC dataset for download.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型在任务特定评估中表现出色，但它们在多语言环境下对文本质量的通用评估能力仍不确定。

Method: 首先自动生成文本质量偏好数据，然后使用这些数据训练开源基础LLMs，使其与高质量和低质量文本的评分对齐。

Result: 在115种语言上的综合评估显示，所提模型性能得到改进，且这种增强的评估能力还能显著改善下游任务。

Conclusion: MTQ-Eval框架在多语言文本质量评估方面表现出色，其增强的评估能力对下游任务也有积极影响。

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) for evaluating outputs is becoming an increasingly effective and scalable approach. However, it remains uncertain whether this capability extends beyond task-specific evaluations to more general assessments of text quality, particularly in multilingual contexts. In this study, we introduce, MTQ-Eval, a novel framework for multilingual text quality evaluation that learns from examples of both high- and low-quality texts, adjusting its internal representations. To develop MTQ-Eval, we first automatically generate text quality preference data and then use it to train open-source base LLMs to align with ratings of high- and low-quality text. Our comprehensive evaluation across 115 languages demonstrates the improved performance of the proposed model. Upon further analysis, we find that this enhanced evaluation capability also leads to notable improvements in downstream tasks.

Motivation: 大型语言模型展现出通过迭代精化自我修正响应的能力，但这种自我修正机制的动态特性在开放式文本生成和多项选择任务中可能存在显著差异，需要系统研究。

Method: 通过在不同自然语言理解和推理任务上比较两种范式的性能趋势和错误修正行为，涵盖不同规模和系列的模型。

Result: 实验结果显示：开放式生成受益于重新解释和组合精化的灵活性，而多项选择可以利用更清晰的解决方案边界但受限于提供的选项。

Conclusion: 自我修正机制的设计应考虑任务结构和输出空间之间的相互作用，这对知识密集型推理和决策导向的LLM应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated remarkable abilities to self-correct their responses through iterative refinement, often referred to as self-consistency or self-reflection. However, the dynamics of this self-correction mechanism may differ substantially depending on whether the model is tasked with open-ended text generation or with selecting the most appropriate response from multiple predefined options. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation of these two paradigms by comparing performance trends and error-correction behaviors across various natural language understanding and reasoning tasks, covering language models of different scales and families. Our experimental results reveal distinct patterns of improvement and failure modes:
  \textit{While open-ended generation often benefits from the flexibility of re-interpretation and compositional refinement, multiple-choice selection can leverage clearer solution boundaries but may be limited by the provided options}. This contrast also reflects the dual demands faced by emerging agentic LLM applications: effective agents must not only generate and refine open-ended plans or explanations, but also make reliable discrete choices when operating within constrained action spaces. Our findings, therefore, highlight that the design of self-correction mechanisms should take into account the interaction between task structure and output space, with implications for both knowledge-intensive reasoning and decision-oriented applications of LLMs.

TL;DR: AMaPO通过自适应边距设计解决离线偏好优化中的过拟合-欠拟合困境，在提升排序准确性和下游对齐性能方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前离线偏好优化方法存在过拟合-欠拟合困境：对正确排序样本施加过多梯度浪费资源，而对错误排序样本提供不足的修正信号，限制了排序准确性的进一步提升。

Method: 提出自适应边距偏好优化(AMaPO)，采用实例级自适应边距，通过Z归一化和指数缩放动态调整学习力度：放大错误排序样本的梯度，抑制正确排序样本的梯度。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试中，AMaPO实现了更好的排序准确性和更优的下游对齐性能，同时有效缓解了过拟合和欠拟合问题。

Conclusion: AMaPO通过自适应边距设计成功解决了离线偏好优化中的核心困境，为语言模型对齐提供了更有效的方法。

Abstract: Offline preference optimization offers a simpler and more stable alternative to RLHF for aligning language models. However, their effectiveness is critically dependent on ranking accuracy, a metric where further gains are highly impactful. This limitation arises from a fundamental problem that we identify and formalize as the Overfitting-Underfitting Dilemma: current margin designs cause models to apply excessive, wasteful gradients to correctly ranked samples (overfitting) while providing insufficient corrective signals for misranked ones (underfitting). To resolve this dilemma, we propose Adaptive Margin-attached Preference Optimization (AMaPO), a simple yet principled algorithm. AMaPO employs an instance-wise adaptive margin, refined by Z-normalization and exponential scaling, which dynamically reallocates learning effort by amplifying gradients for misranked samples and suppressing them for correct ones. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that AMaPO not only achieves better ranking accuracy and superior downstream alignment performance, but targeted analysis also confirms that it successfully mitigates the core overfitting and underfitting issues.

Motivation: 当前商业MLLMs在低资源语言上表现尚可，但开源社区尚未达到同等水平。本文旨在为低资源语言巴斯克语开发强大的MLLM。

Method: 开发了训练和评估用的图像-文本数据集，使用Llama-3.1-Instruct和巴斯克语变体Latxa作为骨干LLM，探索不同数据混合比例进行训练。

Result: 仅需约20%的巴斯克多模态数据即可在巴斯克基准测试中获得坚实结果；出乎意料的是，使用巴斯克指令调优的骨干LLM并非构建强大巴斯克MLLM的必要条件。

Conclusion: 研究结果为其他低资源语言开发MLLMs开辟了道路，并通过公开资源促进了这一进程。

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models exhibit very strong performance for several demanding tasks. While commercial MLLMs deliver acceptable performance in low-resource languages, comparable results remain unattained within the open science community. In this paper, we aim to develop a strong MLLM for a low-resource language, namely Basque. For that purpose, we develop our own training and evaluation image-text datasets. Using two different Large Language Models as backbones, the Llama-3.1-Instruct model and a Basque-adapted variant called Latxa, we explore several data mixtures for training. We show that: i) low ratios of Basque multimodal data (around 20%) are already enough to obtain solid results on Basque benchmarks, and ii) contrary to expected, a Basque instructed backbone LLM is not required to obtain a strong MLLM in Basque. Our results pave the way to develop MLLMs for other low-resource languages by openly releasing our resources.

Conclusion: CARE-Bench为开发更全面、通用和有效的心理咨询模型提供了方向，通过揭示模型失败原因指导未来改进。

Abstract: The mismatch between the growing demand for psychological counseling and the limited availability of services has motivated research into the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this domain. Consequently, there is a need for a robust and unified benchmark to assess the counseling competence of various LLMs. Existing works, however, are limited by unprofessional client simulation, static question-and-answer evaluation formats, and unidimensional metrics. These limitations hinder their effectiveness in assessing a model's comprehensive ability to handle diverse and complex clients. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{CARE-Bench}, a dynamic and interactive automated benchmark. It is built upon diverse client profiles derived from real-world counseling cases and simulated according to expert guidelines. CARE-Bench provides a multidimensional performance evaluation grounded in established psychological scales. Using CARE-Bench, we evaluate several general-purpose LLMs and specialized counseling models, revealing their current limitations. In collaboration with psychologists, we conduct a detailed analysis of the reasons for LLMs' failures when interacting with clients of different types, which provides directions for developing more comprehensive, universal, and effective counseling models.

Abstract: Research in Machine Learning (ML) and AI evolves rapidly. Information Extraction (IE) from scientific publications enables to identify information about research concepts and resources on a large scale and therefore is a pathway to improve understanding and reproducibility of ML-related research. To extract and connect fine-grained information in ML-related research, e.g. method training and data usage, we introduce GSAP-ERE. It is a manually curated fine-grained dataset with 10 entity types and 18 semantically categorized relation types, containing mentions of 63K entities and 35K relations from the full text of 100 ML publications. We show that our dataset enables fine-tuned models to automatically extract information relevant for downstream tasks ranging from knowledge graph (KG) construction, to monitoring the computational reproducibility of AI research at scale. Additionally, we use our dataset as a test suite to explore prompting strategies for IE using Large Language Models (LLM). We observe that the performance of state-of-the-art LLM prompting methods is largely outperformed by our best fine-tuned baseline model (NER: 80.6%, RE: 54.0% for the fine-tuned model vs. NER: 44.4%, RE: 10.1% for the LLM). This disparity of performance between supervised models and unsupervised usage of LLMs suggests datasets like GSAP-ERE are needed to advance research in the domain of scholarly information extraction.

Conclusion: TPoT是一种简单而有效的策略，通过语义相关文本选择不仅解决了输入限制问题，还提升了人格特质预测的性能。

Abstract: Predicting an individual's personalities from their generated texts is a challenging task, especially when the text volume is large. In this paper, we introduce a straightforward yet effective novel strategy called targeted preselection of texts (TPoT). This method semantically filters the texts as input to a deep learning model, specifically designed to predict a Big Five personality trait, facet, or item, referred to as the BIG5-TPoT model. By selecting texts that are semantically relevant to a particular trait, facet, or item, this strategy not only addresses the issue of input text limits in large language models but also improves the Mean Absolute Error and accuracy metrics in predictions for the Stream of Consciousness Essays dataset.

TL;DR: 提出了GIRAM框架，用于持续的下一个兴趣点推荐，通过整合上下文感知的持续兴趣和近期兴趣，实现高效、模型无关的持续学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的下一个兴趣点推荐方法大多依赖静态数据集和固定模型，无法适应随时间变化的用户行为。需要开发能够持续适应演化用户兴趣的模型。

Method: GIRAM框架包含四个组件：兴趣记忆库、上下文感知键编码模块、基于生成键的检索模块、自适应兴趣更新和融合模块。该框架可与现有模型无缝集成。

Result: 在三个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，GIRAM在更新时间和内存消耗方面保持高效率的同时，持续优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: GIRAM是一个高效、模型无关的框架，能够有效解决持续下一个兴趣点推荐中的挑战，平衡持续兴趣和近期兴趣，实现动态适应演化用户行为。

Abstract: Next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation improves personalized location-based services by predicting users' next destinations based on their historical check-ins. However, most existing methods rely on static datasets and fixed models, limiting their ability to adapt to changes in user behavior over time. To address this limitation, we explore a novel task termed continual next POI recommendation, where models dynamically adapt to evolving user interests through continual updates. This task is particularly challenging, as it requires capturing shifting user behaviors while retaining previously learned knowledge. Moreover, it is essential to ensure efficiency in update time and memory usage for real-world deployment. To this end, we propose GIRAM (Generative Key-based Interest Retrieval and Adaptive Modeling), an efficient, model-agnostic framework that integrates context-aware sustained interests with recent interests. GIRAM comprises four components: (1) an interest memory to preserve historical preferences; (2) a context-aware key encoding module for unified interest key representation; (3) a generative key-based retrieval module to identify diverse and relevant sustained interests; and (4) an adaptive interest update and fusion module to update the interest memory and balance sustained and recent interests. In particular, GIRAM can be seamlessly integrated with existing next POI recommendation models. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that GIRAM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining high efficiency in both update time and memory consumption.

Motivation: 现有方法通常将CLIP视为静态特征提取器，忽视了其对神经表征的适应性以及EEG-图像对齐中固有的生理-符号鸿沟。

Method: 采用双流视觉嵌入管道结合动态过滤和token级融合生成实例级自适应提示；引入视觉提示token作为全局模态级提示；提出基于神经科学原理的改进对比损失函数。

Result: 在THINGS-EEG2数据集上，NeuroCLIP在零样本图像检索中达到63.2%的Top-1准确率，比之前最佳方法提升12.3%，并在跨被试条件下表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: NeuroCLIP证明了生理感知提示调优在桥接脑信号和视觉语义方面的巨大潜力，为脑启发人工智能提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in brain-inspired artificial intelligence have sought to align neural signals with visual semantics using multimodal models such as CLIP. However, existing methods often treat CLIP as a static feature extractor, overlooking its adaptability to neural representations and the inherent physiological-symbolic gap in EEG-image alignment. To address these challenges, we present NeuroCLIP, a prompt tuning framework tailored for EEG-to-image contrastive learning. Our approach introduces three core innovations: (1) We design a dual-stream visual embedding pipeline that combines dynamic filtering and token-level fusion to generate instance-level adaptive prompts, which guide the adjustment of patch embedding tokens based on image content, thereby enabling fine-grained modulation of visual representations under neural constraints; (2) We are the first to introduce visual prompt tokens into EEG-image alignment, acting as global, modality- level prompts that work in conjunction with instance-level adjustments. These visual prompt tokens are inserted into the Transformer architecture to facilitate neural-aware adaptation and parameter optimization at a global level; (3) Inspired by neuroscientific principles of human visual encoding, we propose a refined contrastive loss that better model the semantic ambiguity and cross-modal noise present in EEG signals. On the THINGS-EEG2 dataset, NeuroCLIP achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 63.2% in zero-shot image retrieval, surpassing the previous best method by +12.3%, and demonstrates strong generalization under inter-subject conditions (+4.6% Top-1), highlighting the potential of physiology-aware prompt tuning for bridging brain signals and visual semantics.

Motivation: 由于缺乏成熟的衡量标准和基准，验证用户模拟器是否准确反映真实用户行为具有挑战性。

Method: 构建包含160个真实搜索会话的数据集，其中70个会话提供最多62次模拟器运行，分为任务A（预测下一搜索查询）和任务B（预测下一话语）。

Result: 开发了首个公开可用的基准套件，将真实搜索会话与模拟的下一查询预测联系起来，并引入了新的下一查询预测评估指标。

Conclusion: Sim4IA-Bench为评估用户模拟方法提供了基础，促进了可重复研究，并推动了信息访问中现实和可解释用户模拟的进一步发展。

Abstract: Validating user simulation is a difficult task due to the lack of established measures and benchmarks, which makes it challenging to assess whether a simulator accurately reflects real user behavior. As part of the Sim4IA Micro-Shared Task at the Sim4IA Workshop, SIGIR 2025, we present Sim4IA-Bench, a simulation benchmark suit for the prediction of the next queries and utterances, the first of its kind in the IR com- munity. Our dataset as part of the suite comprises 160 real-world search sessions from the CORE search engine. For 70 of these sessions, up to 62 simulator runs are available, divided into Task A and Task B, in which different approaches predicted users next search queries or utterances. Sim4IA-Bench provides a basis for evaluating and comparing user simu- lation approaches and for developing new measures of simulator validity. Although modest in size, the suite represents the first publicly available benchmark that links real search sessions with simulated next-query pre- dictions. In addition to serving as a testbed for next query prediction, it also enables exploratory studies on query reformulation behavior, intent drift, and interaction-aware retrieval evaluation. We also introduce a new measure for evaluating next-query predictions in this task. By making the suite publicly available, we aim to promote reproducible research and stimulate further work on realistic and explainable user simulation for information access: https://github.com/irgroup/Sim4IA-Bench.
