First, current approaches lack a mechanism for automated, data-driven discovery of effective reasoning patterns, relying instead on brittle manual templates or unstable zero-shot prompting. Second, they employ structure-collapsing integration: direct prompting incurs prohibitive online inference costs, while feature extraction collapses reasoning chains into single vectors, discarding stepwise logic. To address these challenges, we propose SCoTER (Structured Chain-of-Thought Transfer for Enhanced Recommendation), a unified framework that treats pattern discovery and structure-aware transfer as a jointly optimized problem. Specifically, SCoTER operationalizes this through two synergistic components: a GVM pipeline for automated pattern discovery and a structure-preserving integration architecture that transfers stepwise logic to efficient models. Formally, we provide information-theoretic justification proving that structure-preserving transfer achieves tighter performance bounds than structure-agnostic alternatives. Empirically, experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate improvements of 3.75\\%-11.59\\% over a strong TIGER backbone. Moreover, in production deployment on the Tencent Advertising Platform, SCoTER achieved a 2.14\\% lift in Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) while eliminating online LLM inference costs. Overall, SCoTER establishes a principled and production-validated blueprint for transferring structured LLM reasoning to large-scale recommender systems."}

Despite current progress, the imbalance issue and transition issue hinder further development of CDSR. The former one presents a phenomenon that the interactions in one domain dominate the entire behavior, leading to difficulty in capturing the domain-specific features in the other domain. The latter points to the difficulty in capturing users' cross-domain preferences within the mixed interaction sequence, resulting in poor next-item prediction performance for specific domains. With world knowledge and powerful reasoning ability, Large Language Models (LLMs) partially alleviate the above issues by performing as a generator and an encoder. However, current LLMs-enhanced CDSR methods are still under exploration, which fail to recognize the irrelevant noise and rough profiling problems. Thus, to make peace with the aforementioned challenges, we proposed an LLMs Enhanced Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation with Dual-phase Training ({LLM-EDT}). To address the imbalance issue while introducing less irrelevant noise, we first propose the transferable item augmenter to adaptively generate possible cross-domain behaviors for users. Then, to alleviate the transition issue, we introduce a dual-phase training strategy to empower the domain-specific thread with a domain-shared background. As for the rough profiling problem, we devise a domain-aware profiling module to summarize the user's preference in each domain and adaptively aggregate them to generate comprehensive user profiles. The experiments on three public datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed LLM-EDT. To ease reproducibility, we have released the detailed code online at {https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-EDT-583F}."}

Recent approaches rely on expensive Large Language Model (LLM) inference for both entity linking and path ranking, limiting their practical deployment. Additionally, LLM-generated answers often lack verifiable grounding in structured knowledge. We present two complementary hybrid algorithms that address both efficiency and verifiability: (1) LLM-Guided Planning that uses a single LLM call to predict relation sequences executed via breadth-first search, achieving near-perfect accuracy (micro-F1 > 0.90) while ensuring all answers are grounded in the knowledge graph, and (2) Embedding-Guided Neural Search that eliminates LLM calls entirely by fusing text and graph embeddings through a lightweight 6.7M-parameter edge scorer, achieving over 100 times speedup with competitive accuracy. Through knowledge distillation, we compress planning capability into a 4B-parameter model that matches large-model performance at zero API cost. Evaluation on MetaQA demonstrates that grounded reasoning consistently outperforms ungrounded generation, with structured planning proving more transferable than direct answer generation. Our results show that verifiable multi-hop reasoning does not require massive models at inference time, but rather the right architectural inductive biases combining symbolic structure with learned representations."}

This study evaluates the faithfulness of LLM-generated explanations in the context of emotion classification in Persian, a low-resource language, by comparing the influential words identified by the model against those identified by human annotators. We assess faithfulness using confidence scores derived from token-level log-probabilities. Two prompting strategies, differing in the order of explanation and prediction (Predict-then-Explain and Explain-then-Predict), are tested for their impact on explanation faithfulness. Our results reveal that while LLMs achieve strong classification performance, their generated explanations often diverge from faithful reasoning, showing greater agreement with each other than with human judgments. These results highlight the limitations of current explanation methods and metrics, emphasizing the need for more robust approaches to ensure LLM reliability in multilingual and low-resource contexts."}

Existing cross-disciplinary methods rely on overlapping entities between disciplines for knowledge transfer through simple mapping functions, but suffer from two key limitations: (1) overlapping entities are scarce in real-world scenarios, and (2) simple mappings inadequately capture cross-disciplinary knowledge complexity. To overcome these challenges, we propose Mixed of Experts and Adversarial Generative Network-based Cross-disciplinary Cold-start Knowledge Tracing Framework. Our approach consists of three key components: First, we pre-train a source discipline model and cluster student knowledge states into K categories. Second, these cluster attributes guide a mixture-of-experts network through a gating mechanism, serving as a cross-domain mapping bridge. Third, an adversarial discriminator enforces feature separation by pulling same-attribute student features closer while pushing different-attribute features apart, effectively mitigating small-sample limitations. We validate our method's effectiveness across 20 extreme cross-disciplinary cold-start scenarios."}

This stems primarily from their prominent capability in distilling, modeling, and generating comprehensive user preferences. However, previous work fails to examine DMs in recommendation tasks through a rigorous lens. In this paper, we first experimentally investigate the completeness of recommender models from a thermodynamic view. We reveal that existing DM-based recommender models operate by maximizing the energy, while classic recommender models operate by reducing the entropy. Based on this finding, we propose a minimalistic diffusion framework that incorporates both factors via the maximization of Helmholtz free energy. Meanwhile, to foster the optimization, our reverse process is armed with a well-designed denoiser to maintain the inherent anisotropy, which measures the user-item cross-correlation in the context of bipartite graphs. Finally, we adopt an Acceptance-Rejection Gumbel Sampling Process (AR-GSP) to prioritize the far-outnumbered unobserved interactions for model robustness. AR-GSP integrates an acceptance-rejection sampling to ensure high-quality hard negative samples for general recommendation tasks, and a timestep-dependent Gumbel Softmax to handle an adaptive sampling strategy for diffusion models. Theoretical analyses and extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework has distinct superiority over baselines in terms of accuracy and efficiency."}

Although they achieve considerable gains, these approaches typically assume the correctness of LLM-generated results and remain susceptible to noise induced by LLM hallucinations. To overcome these limitations, we propose GRASP (Generation Augmented Retrieval with Holistic Attention for Sequential Prediction), a flexible framework that integrates generation augmented retrieval for descriptive synthesis and similarity retrieval, and holistic attention enhancement which employs multi-level attention to effectively employ LLM's world knowledge even with hallucinations and better capture users' dynamic interests. The retrieved similar users/items serve as auxiliary contextual information for the later holistic attention enhancement module, effectively mitigating the noisy guidance of supervision-based methods.

To bridge this gap, we propose HKRAG, a new holistic RAG framework designed to explicitly capture and integrate both knowledge types. Our framework features two key components: (1) a Hybrid Masking-based Holistic Retriever that employs explicit masking strategies to separately model salient and fine-print knowledge, ensuring a query-relevant holistic information retrieval; and (2) an Uncertainty-guided Agentic Generator that dynamically assesses the uncertainty of initial answers and actively decides how to integrate the two distinct knowledge streams for optimal response generation.

EAG introduces a counter-shortcut mechanism by masking the most predictive surface cues, forcing the reranker to learn domain-invariant relevance patterns rather than memorizing dataset-specific entities. To efficiently activate domain experts, R2R employs a lightweight Latent Semantic Router that probes internal representations from the frozen backbone decoder to select the optimal LoRA expert per query. Extensive experiments across different reranker backbones and diverse domains (legal, medical, and financial) demonstrate that R2R consistently surpasses generalist and single-domain fine-tuned baselines.

We measured performance using accuracy, recall, false-positive rate (FPR), and an aggregate score of ROUGE-1, BLEURT, and BERTScore for error correction. We also analyzed example outputs to identify failure modes and differences between LLM and clinician reasoning.\n  Results: Zero-shot prompting showed low recall in both detection tasks, often missing abbreviation-heavy or atypical errors. SPR improved recall but increased FPR.

However, generalist models miss domain-specific nuances in high-stakes fields like finance and law, and naive fine-tuning causes surface-form overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. To address this challenge, we introduce R2R, a domain-aware framework that combines dynamic expert routing with a two-stage training strategy, Entity Abstraction for Generalization (EAG). EAG introduces a counter-shortcut mechanism by masking the most predictive surface cues, forcing the reranker to learn domain-invariant relevance patterns rather than memorizing dataset-specific entities. To efficiently activate domain experts, R2R employs a lightweight Latent Semantic Router that probes internal representations from the frozen backbone decoder to select the optimal LoRA expert per query. Extensive experiments across different reranker backbones and diverse domains (legal, medical, and financial) demonstrate that R2R consistently surpasses generalist and single-domain fine-tuned baselines. Our results confirm that R2R is a model-agnostic and modular approach to domain specialization with strong cross-domain robustness."}

Code available at https://github.com/mihirs-0/synass", "summary": "Transformers are theoretically reversal-invariant: their function class does not prefer left-to-right over right-to-left mappings. Yet empirical studies on natural language repeatedly report a \"reversal curse,\" and recent work on temporal asymmetry in LLMs suggests that real-world corpora carry their own arrow of time. This leaves an unresolved question: do directional failures stem from linguistic statistics, or from the architecture itself? We cut through this ambiguity with a fully synthetic, entropy-controlled benchmark designed as a clean-room stress test for directional learning. Using random string mappings with tunable branching factor K, we construct forward tasks with zero conditional entropy and inverse tasks with analytically determined entropy floors. Excess loss above these floors reveals that even scratch-trained GPT-2 models exhibit a strong, reproducible directional optimization gap (e.g., 1.16 nats at K=5), far larger than that of an MLP trained on the same data. Pre-trained initializations shift optimization behavior but do not eliminate this gap, while LoRA encounters a sharp capacity wall on high-entropy inverse mappings. Together, these results isolate a minimal, semantics-free signature of directional friction intrinsic to causal Transformer training-one that persists even when linguistic priors, token frequencies, and corpus-level temporal asymmetries are removed. Our benchmark provides a controlled instrument for dissecting directional biases in modern sequence models and motivates deeper mechanistic study of why inversion remains fundamentally harder for Transformers."}

We conducted a comprehensive evaluation comparing traditional lexical models, hybrid approaches, and several end-to-end fine-tuned transformers. Our results demonstrate that end-to-end fine-tuning is critical for performance, with the domain-adapted MentalBERT emerging as the top model, achieving an accuracy of 0.92 and a Macro F1 score of 0.76, surpassing both its generic counterpart and a zero-shot LLM baseline. Grounded in a comprehensive ethical analysis, we frame the system as a human-in-the-loop screening aid, not a diagnostic tool.

To alleviate this gap, we propose Online-PVLM, a framework for online concept learning by leveraging hyperbolic representations.

However, the prevalent approach of fine-tuning a separate module for each user faces two major limitations: (1) storage costs scale linearly with the number of users, rendering the method unscalable; and (2) fine-tuning a static model from scratch often yields suboptimal performance for users with sparse data. To address these challenges, we propose MTA, a Merge-then-Adapt framework for PLLMs. MTA comprises three key stages. First, we construct a shared Meta-LoRA Bank by selecting anchor users and pre-training meta-personalization traits within meta-LoRA modules. Second, to ensure scalability and enable dynamic personalization combination beyond static models, we introduce an Adaptive LoRA Fusion stage. This stage retrieves and dynamically merges the most relevant anchor meta-LoRAs to synthesize a user-specific one, thereby eliminating the need for user-specific storage and supporting more flexible personalization. Third, we propose a LoRA Stacking for Few-Shot Personalization stage, which applies an additional ultra-low-rank, lightweight LoRA module on top of the merged LoRA. Fine-tuning this module enables effective personalization under few-shot settings. Extensive experiments on the LaMP benchmark demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing SOTA methods across multiple tasks."}

However, existing approaches face key limitations: answer choices are typically presented to LLMs without contextual grounding or explanation. This absence of context can lead to incomplete exploration of all possible answers, ultimately degrading the models' reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce BiasPrompting, a novel inference framework that guides LLMs to generate and critically evaluate reasoning across all plausible answer options before reaching a final prediction. It consists of two components: first, a reasoning generation stage, where the model is prompted to produce supportive reasonings for each answer option, and then, a reasoning-guided agreement stage, where the generated reasonings are synthesized to select the most plausible answer. Through comprehensive evaluations, BiasPrompting demonstrates significant improvements in five widely used multiple-choice question answering benchmarks. Our experiments showcase that BiasPrompting enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs and provides a strong foundation for tackling complex and challenging questions, particularly in settings where existing methods underperform."}

Sparse attention mitigates this cost by restricting each query to attend to a subset of previous tokens; however, training-free approaches often lead to severe performance degradation. Native sparse-attention methods (e.g., NSA, MoBA) alleviate this issue, yet exhibit a critical paradox: they produce lower attention sparsity than full-attention models, despite aiming to approximate full attention, which may constrain their effectiveness. We attribute this paradox to gradient update deficiency: low-ranked key-value pairs excluded during sparse training receive neither forward contribution nor backward gradients, and thus never learn proper suppression. To overcome this limitation, we propose SSA (Sparse Sparse Attention), a unified training framework that considers both sparse and full attention and enforces bidirectional alignment at every layer. This design preserves gradient flow to all tokens while explicitly encouraging sparse-attention outputs to align with their full-attention counterparts, thereby promoting stronger sparsity. As a result, SSA achieves state-of-the-art performance under both sparse and full attention inference across multiple commonsense benchmarks. Furthermore, SSA enables models to adapt smoothly to varying sparsity budgets; performance improves consistently as more tokens are allowed to attend, supporting flexible compute-performance trade-offs at inference time. Finally, we show that native sparse-attention training surprisingly improves long-context extrapolation by mitigating the over-allocation of attention values in sink areas, with SSA demonstrating the strongest extrapolation capability."}

While recent advances in transformer-based models and large annotated datasets have greatly improved GEC performance for high-resource languages such as English, the progress has not extended equally. For most Indic languages, GEC remains a challenging task due to limited resources, linguistic diversity and complex morphology. In this work, we explore prompting-based approaches using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4.1, Gemini-2.5 and LLaMA-4, combined with few-shot strategy to adapt them to low-resource settings. We observe that even basic prompting strategies, such as zero-shot and few-shot approaches, enable these LLMs to substantially outperform fine-tuned Indic-language models like Sarvam-22B, thereby illustrating the exceptional multilingual generalization capabilities of contemporary LLMs for GEC. Our experiments show that carefully designed prompts and lightweight adaptation significantly enhance correction quality across multiple Indic languages. We achieved leading results in the shared task--ranking 1st in Tamil (GLEU: 91.57) and Hindi (GLEU: 85.69), 2nd in Telugu (GLEU: 85.22), 4th in Bangla (GLEU: 92.86), and 5th in Malayalam (GLEU: 92.97).

The primary difficulty lies in text segmentation, as traditional methods often missegment or entirely miss cross-sentence discontinuous entities, significantly affecting recognition accuracy. Therefore, we aim to address the segmentation and omission issues associated with such entities. Recent studies have shown that grid-tagging methods are effective for information extraction due to their flexible tagging schemes and robust architectures. Building on this, we integrate image data augmentation techniques, such as cropping, scaling, and padding, into grid-based models to enhance their ability to recognize discontinuous entities and handle segmentation challenges. Experimental results demonstrate that traditional segmentation methods often fail to capture cross-sentence discontinuous entities, leading to decreased performance. In contrast, our augmented grid models achieve notable improvements. Evaluations on the CADEC, ShARe13, and ShARe14 datasets show F1 score gains of 1-2.5% overall and 3.7-8.4% for discontinuous entities, confirming the effectiveness of our approach."}

However, existing large language model-based (LLM-based) approaches often rely heavily on external knowledge sources, introducing substantial latency and even hallucinations that undermine reliability, interpretability, and responsiveness, which is crucial for real-time use. To address these challenges, we propose REason-guided Fact-checking with Latent EXplanations REFLEX paradigm, a plug-and-play, self-refining paradigm that leverages the internal knowledge in backbone model to improve both verdict accuracy and explanation quality. REFLEX reformulates fact-checking as a role-play dialogue and jointly trains verdict prediction and explanation generation. It adaptively extracts contrastive activation pairs between the backbone model and its fine-tuned variant to construct steering vectors that disentangle truth into style and substance naturally. These activation-level signals guide inference and suppress noisy explanations, enabling more faithful and efficient reasoning. Experiments on real-world datasets show that REFLEX outperforms previous methods that steer toward a single truth direction and underscores the challenge traditional approaches face when handling the subtle, human-unknown truth in fact-checking tasks. Remarkably, with only 465 self-refined training samples, RELFEX achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, models trained with explanatory objectives can effectively guide those without them, yielding up to a 7.57% improvement, highlighting that internal explanation signals play a dual role in both interpreting and enhancing factual reasoning."}

Current speculative decoding methods typically assume a considerable amount of available computing power, then generate a complex and massive draft tree using a small autoregressive language model to improve overall prediction accuracy. However, methods like batching have been widely applied in mainstream model inference systems as a superior alternative to speculative decoding, as they compress the available idle computing power. Therefore, performing speculative decoding with low verification resources and low scheduling costs has become an important research problem. We believe that more capable models that allow for parallel generation on draft sequences are what we truly need. Recognizing the fundamental nature of draft models to only generate sequences of limited length, we propose SpecFormer, a novel architecture that integrates unidirectional and bidirectional attention mechanisms. SpecFormer combines the autoregressive model's ability to extract information from the entire input sequence with the parallel generation benefits of non-autoregressive models. This design eliminates the reliance on large prefix trees and achieves consistent acceleration, even in large-batch scenarios. Through lossless speculative decoding experiments across models of various scales, we demonstrate that SpecFormer sets a new standard for scaling LLM inference with lower training demands and reduced computational costs."}

While prior work has shown that LLMs can represent task patterns and surface-level concepts, it remains unclear whether these models can encode high-level relational concepts and apply them to novel situations through structured comparisons. In this work, we explore this fundamental aspect using proportional and story analogies, and identify three key findings. First, LLMs effectively encode the underlying relationships between analogous entities; both attributive and relational information propagate through mid-upper layers in correct cases, whereas reasoning failures reflect missing relational information within these layers. Second, unlike humans, LLMs often struggle not only when relational information is missing, but also when attempting to apply it to new entities. In such cases, strategically patching hidden representations at critical token positions can facilitate information transfer to a certain extent. Lastly, successful analogical reasoning in LLMs is marked by strong structural alignment between analogous situations, whereas failures often reflect degraded or misplaced alignment. Overall, our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit emerging but limited capabilities in encoding and applying high-level relational concepts, highlighting both parallels and gaps with human cognition."}

However, evaluating stemming methods is challenging because current evaluation approaches are limited and do not capture the potential harm caused by excessive stemming; therefore, it is essential to develop new approaches to evaluate stemming methods. To address this issue, this study propose a novel, task-oriented approach to evaluate stemming methods, which considers three aspects: (1) the utility of stemming using Stemming Effectiveness Score (SES), (2) the impact of stemming on downstream tasks using Model Performance Delta (MPD), and (3) the semantic similarity between stemmed and original words using Average Normalized Levenshtein Distance (ANLD), thus providing a comprehensive evaluation framework. We apply our evaluation framework to compare two stemmers for Bangla (BNLTK) and English (Snowball), and our results reveal a significant issue, prompting us to analyze their performance in detail. While the Bangla stemmer achieves the highest SES (1.67) due to effective word reduction (CR = 1.90), SES alone is insufficient because our proposed safety measure, ANLD, reveals that this high SES is due to harmful over-stemming (ANLD = 0.26), which correlates with the observed decrease in downstream performance.In contrast, the English stemmer achieves a moderate SES (1.31) with a safe meaning distance (ANLD = 0.14), allowing its word reduction to contribute positively to downstream performance; therefore, it is a more reliable stemmer. Our study provides a valuable tool for distinguishing between potential efficiency gains (high SES) and meaning preservation (low ANLD)."}
