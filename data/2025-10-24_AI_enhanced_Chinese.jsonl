We develop a lightweight and simple mean-pooling\napproach that consistently outperforms the widely used compression-tokens\narchitecture, and study training the same compressor to output multiple\ncompression ratios. We conduct extensive experiments across in-domain and\nout-of-domain QA datasets, as well as across model families, scales, and\ncompression ratios. Overall, our simple mean-pooling approach achieves the\nstrongest performance, with a relatively small drop when training for multiple\ncompression ratios. More broadly though, across architectures and training\nregimes the trade-offs are more nuanced, illustrating the complex landscape of\ncompression methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, there\nis no consistent or precise definition of their target, namely \"LLM-generated\ntext\". Differences in usage scenarios and the diversity of LLMs further\nincrease the difficulty of detection. What is commonly regarded as the\ndetecting target usually represents only a subset of the text that LLMs can\npotentially produce. Human edits to LLM outputs, together with the subtle\ninfluences that LLMs exert on their users, are blurring the line between\nLLM-generated and human-written text. Existing benchmarks and evaluation\napproaches do not adequately address the various conditions in real-world\ndetector applications. Hence, the numerical results of detectors are often\nmisunderstood, and their significance is diminishing. Therefore, detectors\nremain useful under specific conditions, but their results should be\ninterpreted only as references rather than decisive indicators.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
