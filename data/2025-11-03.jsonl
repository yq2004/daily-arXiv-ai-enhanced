This paper\nintroduces BiSparse-AAS (Bilinear Sparse Attention with Adaptive Spans), a\nnovel framework that combines sparse attention, adaptive spans, and bilinear\nattention to address these limitations. Sparse attention reduces computational\ncosts by focusing on the most relevant parts of the input, while adaptive spans\ndynamically adjust the attention ranges. Bilinear attention complements both by\nmodeling complex token interactions within this refined context. BiSparse-AAS\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both extractive and\nabstractive summarization tasks, achieving average ROUGE improvements of about\n68.1% on CNN/DailyMail and 52.6% on XSum, while maintaining strong performance\non OpenWebText and Gigaword datasets. By addressing efficiency, scalability,\nand long-sequence modeling, BiSparse-AAS provides a unified, practical solution\nfor real-world text summarization applications."}

However, these summaries often focus on\npatients' biology rather than their preferences, values, wishes, and concerns.\nTo achieve patient-centered care, we propose a new standard for Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) clinical summarization tasks: Patient-Centered Summaries\n(PCS). Our objective was to develop a framework to generate PCS that capture\npatient values and ensure clinical utility and to assess whether current\nopen-source LLMs can achieve human-level performance in this task. We used a\nmixed-methods process. Two Patient and Public Involvement groups (10 patients\nand 8 clinicians) in the United Kingdom participated in semi-structured\ninterviews exploring what personal and contextual information should be\nincluded in clinical summaries and how it should be structured for clinical\nuse. Findings informed annotation guidelines used by eight clinicians to create\ngold-standard PCS from 88 atrial fibrillation consultations. Sixteen\nconsultations were used to refine a prompt aligned with the guidelines. Five\nopen-source LLMs (Llama-3.2-3B, Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-8B, Gemma-3-4B, and\nQwen3-8B) generated summaries for 72 consultations using zero-shot and few-shot\nprompting, evaluated with ROUGE-L, BERTScore, and qualitative metrics.

Although multilingual bidirectional encoder representations from\ntransformers (BERT) offers a promising motivation to mitigate the language gap,\nthe medical NLP tasks in low-resource languages are still underexplored.\nTherefore, this study investigates how further pre-training on domain-specific\ncorpora affects model performance on medical tasks, focusing on three\nlanguages: Dutch, Romanian and Spanish. In terms of further pre-training, we\nconducted four experiments to create medical domain models. Then, these models\nwere fine-tuned on three downstream tasks: Automated patient screening in Dutch\nclinical notes, named entity recognition in Romanian and Spanish clinical\nnotes. Results show that domain adaptation significantly enhanced task\nperformance. Furthermore, further differentiation of domains, e.g. clinical and\ngeneral biomedical domains, resulted in diverse performances. The clinical\ndomain-adapted model outperformed the more general biomedical domain-adapted\nmodel. Moreover, we observed evidence of cross-lingual transferability.\nMoreover, we also conducted further investigations to explore potential reasons\ncontributing to these performance differences. These findings highlight the\nfeasibility of domain adaptation and cross-lingual ability in medical NLP.\nWithin the low-resource language settings, these findings can provide\nmeaningful guidance for developing multilingual medical NLP systems to mitigate\nthe lack of training data and thereby improve the model performance."}

This method provides direct feedback on the model's\ncurrent knowledge, guiding it to align with domain-specific standards.\nExperiments in English-Brazilian Portuguese and English-Korean show that, by\nusing just 14.7k preference pairs, the model achieves performance close to that\nof a model trained on 160k+ samples with SFT, demonstrating significant data\nefficiency.

Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) addresses this issue by grounding LLMs in external knowledge;\nHowever, the effectiveness of RAG critically depends on whether the model can\nadequately access relevant information. Existing RAG systems rely on a single\nretriever with fixed top-k selection, restricting access to a narrow and static\nsubset of the corpus. As a result, this single-retriever paradigm has become\nthe primary bottleneck for comprehensive external information acquisition,\nespecially in tasks requiring corpus-level reasoning. To overcome this\nlimitation, we propose MARAG-R1, a reinforcement-learned multi-tool RAG\nframework that enables LLMs to dynamically coordinate multiple retrieval\nmechanisms for broader and more precise information access. MARAG-R1 equips the\nmodel with four retrieval tools -- semantic search, keyword search, filtering,\nand aggregation -- and learns both how and when to use them through a two-stage\ntraining process: supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning.\nThis design allows the model to interleave reasoning and retrieval,\nprogressively gathering sufficient evidence for corpus-level synthesis.\nExperiments on GlobalQA, HotpotQA, and 2WikiMultiHopQA demonstrate that\nMARAG-R1 substantially outperforms strong baselines and achieves new\nstate-of-the-art results in corpus-level reasoning tasks."}

Our key insight is to exploit the attention weights already\ncomputed by the draft model during speculative decoding to identify important\ntokens for the target model, eliminating redundant computation while\nmaintaining output quality. SpecAttn employs three core techniques: KL\ndivergence-based layer alignment between draft and target models, a\nGPU-optimized sorting-free algorithm for top-p token selection from draft\nattention patterns, and dynamic key-value cache pruning guided by these\npredictions. By leveraging the computational work already performed in standard\nspeculative decoding pipelines, SpecAttn achieves over 75% reduction in\nkey-value cache accesses with a mere 15.29% increase in perplexity on the PG-19\ndataset, significantly outperforming existing sparse attention methods.

How do we find such\nknowledge that is (1) salient to in-group users, but (2) unknown to LLMs? The\nmost common solutions are single-initiative: either researchers define\nchallenging questions that users passively answer (traditional annotation), or\nusers actively produce data that researchers structure as benchmarks (knowledge\nextraction). The process would benefit from mixed-initiative collaboration,\nwhere users guide the process to meaningfully reflect their cultures, and LLMs\nsteer the process towards more challenging questions that meet the researcher's\ngoals. We propose a mixed-initiative methodology called CultureCartography.\nHere, an LLM initializes annotation with questions for which it has\nlow-confidence answers, making explicit both its prior knowledge and the gaps\ntherein. This allows a human respondent to fill these gaps and steer the model\ntowards salient topics through direct edits. We implement this methodology as a\ntool called CultureExplorer.

To this end, we introduce\nContinuous Autoregressive Language Models (CALM), a paradigm shift from\ndiscrete next-token prediction to continuous next-vector prediction. CALM uses\na high-fidelity autoencoder to compress a chunk of K tokens into a single\ncontinuous vector, from which the original tokens can be reconstructed with\nover 99.9\\% accuracy. This allows us to model language as a sequence of\ncontinuous vectors instead of discrete tokens, which reduces the number of\ngenerative steps by a factor of K.
