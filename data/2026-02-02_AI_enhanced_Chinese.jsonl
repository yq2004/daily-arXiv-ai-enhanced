This paper investigates drunk language, i.e., text written under the influence of alcohol, as a driver for safety failures in large language models (LLMs). We investigate three mechanisms for inducing drunk language in LLMs: persona-based prompting, causal fine-tuning, and reinforcement-based post-training. When evaluated on 5 LLMs, we observe a higher susceptibility to jailbreaking on JailbreakBench (even in the presence of defences) and privacy leaks on ConfAIde, where both benchmarks are in English, as compared to the base LLMs as well as previously reported approaches. Via a robust combination of manual evaluation and LLM-based evaluators and analysis of error categories, our findings highlight a correspondence between human-intoxicated behaviour, and anthropomorphism in LLMs induced with drunk language. The simplicity and efficiency of our drunk language inducement approaches position them as potential counters for LLM safety tuning, highlighting significant risks to LLM safety.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\"\u9189\u9152\u8bed\u8a00\"\u8bf1\u5bfcLLMs\u4ea7\u751f\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u8bf1\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u9152\u7cbe\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u4e0d\u826f\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u60f3\u63a2\u7d22LLMs\u5728\u7c7b\u4f3c\"\u9189\u9152\u8bed\u8a00\"\u8bf1\u5bfc\u4e0b\u662f\u5426\u4e5f\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u8bf1\u5bfcLLMs\u4ea7\u751f\u9189\u9152\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\uff1b2) \u56e0\u679c\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b3) \u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u57285\u4e2aLLMs\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528JailbreakBench\u548cConfAIde\u4e24\u4e2a\u82f1\u6587\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u9189\u9152\u8bed\u8a00\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684LLMs\u5728JailbreakBench\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u6613\u611f\u6027\uff08\u5373\u4f7f\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\uff09\uff0c\u5728ConfAIde\u4e0a\u51fa\u73b0\u66f4\u591a\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u9189\u9152\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0eLLMs\u5728\u9189\u9152\u8bed\u8a00\u8bf1\u5bfc\u4e0b\u7684\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9189\u9152\u8bed\u8a00\u8bf1\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6297LLM\u5b89\u5168\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u4e86LLM\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u91cd\u5927\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u8bf1\u5bfc\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u9189\u9152\u7684\u4e0d\u826f\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u52a0\u5f3a\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\u3002"}}

Based on this theory, we introduce two training-free extensions, MrRoPE-Uni and MrRoPE-Pro, which leverage uniform and progressive radix conversion strategies, respectively, to achieve 'train short, test long' generalization. Without fine-tuning, MrRoPE-Pro sustains over 85% recall in the 128K-context Needle-in-a-Haystack test and achieves more than double YaRN's accuracy on Infinite-Bench retrieval and dialogue subsets.

At test time, collaborative reasoning through Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as a promising approach for enhancing LLM performance.

In this work, we propose Self-Debate Reinforcement Learning (SDRL), a training framework that equips a single LLM with strong standalone problem-solving ability and the capability to learn from diverse reasoning trajectories in MAD. Given a prompt, SDRL first samples multiple candidate solutions, then constructs a debate context with diverse reasoning paths and generates second-turn responses conditioned on this context. Finally, SDRL jointly optimizes both the initial and debate-conditioned responses, yielding a model that is effective as both a standalone solver and a debate participant.

Large language models (LLMs) have recently enabled substantial progress in automated veracity assessment, including automated fact-checking and claim verification systems. Typical veracity assessment pipelines break down complex claims into sub-claims, retrieve external evidence, and then apply LLM reasoning to assess veracity. However, existing methods often treat evidence retrieval as a static, isolated step and do not effectively manage or reuse retrieved evidence across claims. In this work, we propose MERMAID, a memory-enhanced multi-agent veracity assessment framework that tightly couples the retrieval and reasoning processes. MERMAID integrates agent-driven search, structured knowledge representations, and a persistent memory module within a Reason-Action style iterative process, enabling dynamic evidence acquisition and cross-claim evidence reuse. By retaining retrieved evidence in an evidence memory, the framework reduces redundant searches and improves verification efficiency and consistency. We evaluate MERMAID on three fact-checking benchmarks and two claim-verification datasets using multiple LLMs, including GPT, LLaMA, and Qwen families.

Language models can also adapt to diverse tasks and learn new structure in context, and recent work has shown that this in-context learning (ICL) can be reflected in representational changes. Here we bring these two lines of research together to explore whether representation straightening occurs \\emph{within} a context during ICL. We measure representational straightening in Gemma 2 models across a diverse set of in-context tasks, and uncover a dichotomy in how LLMs' representations change in context. In continual prediction settings (e.g., natural language, grid world traversal tasks) we observe that increasing context increases the straightness of neural sequence trajectories, which is correlated with improvement in model prediction. Conversely, in structured prediction settings (e.g., few-shot tasks), straightening is inconsistent -- it is only present in phases of the task with explicit structure (e.g., repeating a template), but vanishes elsewhere. These results suggest that ICL is not a monolithic process.

With large language models (LLMs) on the cloud, semantic user representations can improve sequential recommendation by capturing high-level intent. However, regenerating such representations via cloud LLM inference for every request is often infeasible at real-world scale. As a result, on-device reranking commonly reuses a cached cloud semantic user embedding across requests. We empirically identify a cloud semantic staleness effect: reused embeddings become less aligned with the user's latest interactions, leading to measurable ranking degradation.\n  Most existing LLM-enabled cloud-device recommenders are typically designed around on-demand cloud semantics, either by assuming low-latency cloud LLM access or by regenerating semantic embeddings per request. When per-request regeneration is infeasible and cached semantics must be reused, two technical challenges arise: (1) deciding when cached cloud semantics remain useful for on-device reranking, and (2) maintaining ranking quality when the cloud LLM cannot be invoked and only cached semantics are available. To address this gap, we introduce the Semantic Calibration for LLM-enabled Cloud-Device Recommendation (SCaLRec).

We argue these should be treated jointly. Across two clinical tasks (MedAlign applicability/correctness and MS subtype abstraction) and multiple open and proprietary models, we measure prompt sensitivity via flip rates and relate it to calibration and selective prediction. We find that higher accuracy does not guarantee prompt stability, and that models can appear well-calibrated yet remain fragile to paraphrases. We propose a dual-objective prompt optimization loop that jointly targets accuracy and stability, showing that explicitly including a stability term reduces flip rates across tasks and models, sometimes at modest accuracy cost.

PersonaAct synthesizes interpretable personas through automated interviews combining behavioral analysis with structured questioning, then trains agents on multimodal observations using supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. We deploy trained agents for filter bubble auditing and evaluate bubble breadth via content diversity and bubble depth via escape potential. The evaluation demonstrates substantial improvements in fidelity over generic LLM baselines, enabling realistic behavior reproduction. Results reveal significant content narrowing over interaction.

To address these limitations, we introduce Sparse Plus Linear Attention (SPLA), a framework that utilizes a selection metric derived from second-order Taylor expansions to accurately identify relevant blocks for exact attention. Instead of discarding the remaining \"long tail,\" SPLA compresses unselected blocks into a compact recurrent state via a residual linear attention (RLA) module. Crucially, to avoid IO overhead, we derive an optimized subtraction-based formulation for RLA -- calculating the residual as the difference between global and selected linear attention -- ensuring that unselected blocks are never explicitly accessed during inference. Our experiments demonstrate that SPLA closes the performance gap in continual pretraining, surpassing dense attention models on long-context benchmarks like RULER while maintaining competitive general knowledge and reasoning capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "SPLA\u63d0\u51fa\u7a00\u758f\u52a0\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u9636\u6cf0\u52d2\u5c55\u5f00\u51c6\u786e\u9009\u62e9\u76f8\u5173\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u786e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7528\u6b8b\u5dee\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u538b\u7f29\u672a\u9009\u5757\u4e3a\u7d27\u51d1\u5faa\u73af\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u907f\u514dIO\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5757\u7ea7\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u9009\u62e9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4f4e\u548c\u7d2f\u79ef\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e22\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b8c\u5168\u4e22\u5f03\u672a\u9009\u5757\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "1) \u4f7f\u7528\u4e8c\u9636\u6cf0\u52d2\u5c55\u5f00\u5bfc\u51fa\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6307\u6807\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u76f8\u5173\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u786e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b(RLA)\u6a21\u5757\u5c06\u672a\u9009\u5757\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u7d27\u51d1\u5faa\u73af\u72b6\u6001\uff1b3) \u91c7\u7528\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u51cf\u6cd5\u7684RLA\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u907f\u514dIO\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u63a8\u7406\u671f\u95f4\u4e0d\u663e\u5f0f\u8bbf\u95ee\u672a\u9009\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eSPLA\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7f29\u5c0f\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5728RULER\u7b49\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u5bc6\u96c6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "SPLA\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7cbe\u786e\u5757\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u672a\u9009\u5757\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u3002"}}

However, most large-scale ranking systems rely on item IDs, where each item is treated as an independent categorical symbol and mapped to a learned embedding. As items rapidly appear and disappear, these embeddings become difficult to train and maintain. This instability impedes effective learning of neural network parameters and limits the scalability of ranking models. In this paper, we show that semantic tokens possess greater scaling potential compared to item IDs. Our proposed framework TRM improves the token generation and application pipeline, leading to 33% reduction in sparse storage while achieving 0.85% AUC increase. Extensive experiments further show that TRM could consistently outperform state-of-the-art models when model capacity scales.

While recent foundation models enable rich semantic representations across vision, audio, and language, retrieving relevant observations from massive archives remains challenging due to the computational cost of high-dimensional similarity search. In this work, we introduce compact hypercube embeddings for fast text-based wildlife observation retrieval, a framework that enables efficient text-based search over large-scale wildlife image and audio databases using compact binary representations. Building on the cross-view code alignment hashing framework, we extend lightweight hashing beyond a single-modality setup to align natural language descriptions with visual or acoustic observations in a shared Hamming space. Our approach leverages pretrained wildlife foundation models, including BioCLIP and BioLingual, and adapts them efficiently for hashing using parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We evaluate our method on large-scale benchmarks, including iNaturalist2024 for text-to-image retrieval and iNatSounds2024 for text-to-audio retrieval, as well as multiple soundscape datasets to assess robustness under domain shift. Results show that retrieval using discrete hypercube embeddings achieves competitive, and in several cases superior, performance compared to continuous embeddings, while drastically reducing memory and search cost. Moreover, we observe that the hashing objective consistently improves the underlying encoder representations, leading to stronger retrieval and zero-shot generalization.

This paper evaluates single-agent and multi-agent LLM architectures for essay grading using the ASAP 2.0 corpus. Our multi-agent system decomposes grading into three specialist agents (Content, Structure, Language) coordinated by a Chairman Agent that implements rubric-aligned logic including veto rules and score capping. We test both architectures in zero-shot and few-shot conditions using GPT-5.1. Results show that the multi-agent system is significantly better at identifying weak essays while the single-agent system performs better on mid-range essays. Both architectures struggle with high-quality essays. Critically, few-shot calibration emerges as the dominant factor in system performance -- providing just two examples per score level improves QWK by approximately 26% for both architectures. These findings suggest architectural choice should align with specific deployment priorities, with multi-agent AI particularly suited for diagnostic screening of at-risk students, while single-agent models provide a cost-effective solution for general assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u4f5c\u6587\u8bc4\u5206\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u5f31\u4f5c\u6587\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e2d\u6863\u4f5c\u6587\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u5728\u9ad8\u8d28\u4f5c\u6587\u4e0a\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5c11\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u6821\u51c6\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u81ea\u52a8\u4f5c\u6587\u8bc4\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8d28\u91cf\u6c34\u5e73\u4f5c\u6587\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528ASAP 2.0\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u8bc4\u4f30\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c06\u8bc4\u5206\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e13\u4e1a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff08\u5185\u5bb9\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\uff09\uff0c\u7531\u4e3b\u5e2d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u8c03\u5b9e\u65bd\u5305\u62ec\u5426\u51b3\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u5206\u6570\u4e0a\u9650\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f7f\u7528GPT-5.1\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u5f31\u4f5c\u6587\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e2d\u6863\u4f5c\u6587\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u5728\u9ad8\u8d28\u4f5c\u6587\u4e0a\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u5c11\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u6821\u51c6\u662f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u4e3b\u5bfc\u56e0\u7d20\u2014\u2014\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bc4\u5206\u7b49\u7ea7\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e24\u4e2a\u793a\u4f8b\u5c31\u80fd\u5c06QWK\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ea626%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u5e94\u4e0e\u5177\u4f53\u90e8\u7f72\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u5bf9\u6709\u98ce\u9669\u5b66\u751f\u8fdb\u884c\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u7b5b\u67e5\uff0c\u800c\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u4e00\u822c\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u9ad8\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

These methods typically employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to adapt LLMs to recommendation scenarios, and utilize beam search during inference to efficiently retrieve $B$ top-ranked recommended items. However, we identify a critical training-inference inconsistency: while SFT optimizes the overall probability of positive items, it does not guarantee that such items will be retrieved by beam search even if they possess high overall probabilities. Due to the greedy pruning mechanism, beam search can prematurely discard a positive item once its prefix probability is insufficient.\n  To address this inconsistency, we propose BEAR (Beam-SEarch-Aware Regularization), a novel fine-tuning objective that explicitly accounts for beam search behavior during training. Rather than directly simulating beam search for each instance during training, which is computationally prohibitive, BEAR enforces a relaxed necessary condition: each token in a positive item must rank within the top-$B$ candidate tokens at each decoding step. This objective effectively mitigates the risk of incorrect pruning while incurring negligible computational overhead compared to standard SFT. Extensive experiments across four real-world datasets demonstrate that BEAR significantly outperforms strong baselines.

This paper investigates the alignment of synthetic, culturally-grounded personas with established frameworks, specifically the World Values Survey (WVS), the Inglehart-Welzel Cultural Map, and Moral Foundations Theory. We conceptualize and produce LLM-generated personas based on a set of interpretable WVS-derived variables, and we examine the generated personas through three complementary lenses: positioning on the Inglehart-Welzel map, which unveils their interpretation reflecting stable differences across cultural conditionings; demographic-level consistency with the World Values Survey, where response distributions broadly track human group patterns; and moral profiles derived from a Moral Foundations questionnaire, which we analyze through a culture-to-morality mapping to characterize how moral responses vary across different cultural configurations. Our approach of culturally-grounded persona generation and analysis enables evaluation of cross-cultural structure and moral variation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6587\u5316\u57fa\u7840\u4eba\u7269\u89d2\u8272\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u4e0d\u540c\u6587\u5316\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u548c\u9053\u5fb7\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e16\u754c\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u8c03\u67e5\u3001\u82f1\u683c\u5c14\u54c8\u7279-\u97e6\u5c14\u6cfd\u5c14\u6587\u5316\u5730\u56fe\u548c\u9053\u5fb7\u57fa\u7840\u7406\u8bba\u4e09\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u65b9\u9762\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u6709\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5408\u6210\u4eba\u7269\u89d2\u8272\u5728\u591a\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u4e0d\u540c\u6587\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u548c\u9053\u5fb7\u4ef7\u503c\u4f53\u7cfb\u4ecd\u7136\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6587\u5316\u57fa\u7840\u4eba\u7269\u89d2\u8272\u662f\u5426\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u5316\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u6846\u67b6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u89c6\u89d2\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4eba\u7269\u89d2\u8272\uff1a1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u4e16\u754c\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u8c03\u67e5\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u53d8\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u6587\u5316\u57fa\u7840\u4eba\u7269\u89d2\u8272\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u82f1\u683c\u5c14\u54c8\u7279-\u97e6\u5c14\u6cfd\u5c14\u6587\u5316\u5730\u56fe\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5206\u6790\u6587\u5316\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b3) \u4f7f\u7528\u9053\u5fb7\u57fa\u7840\u95ee\u5377\u5206\u6790\u9053\u5fb7\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u6587\u5316\u5230\u9053\u5fb7\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1) \u751f\u6210\u7684\u4eba\u7269\u89d2\u8272\u5728\u82f1\u683c\u5c14\u54c8\u7279-\u97e6\u5c14\u6cfd\u5c14\u5730\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u6587\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b2) \u5728\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u5206\u5e03\u5927\u81f4\u9075\u5faa\u4eba\u7c7b\u7fa4\u4f53\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b3) \u9053\u5fb7\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6587\u5316\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u9053\u5fb7\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u5316\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u4eba\u7269\u89d2\u8272\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u9053\u5fb7\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u6587\u5316\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Current retrieval systems either ignore these constraints in neural embeddings or approximate them in a generative reasoning process that can be inconsistent and unreliable. Although well-suited to structured reasoning, existing neuro-symbolic approaches remain confined to formal logic or mathematics problems as they often assume unambiguous queries and access to complete evidence, conditions rarely met in information retrieval. To bridge this gap, we introduce OrLog, a neuro-symbolic retrieval framework that decouples predicate-level plausibility estimation from logical reasoning: a large language model (LLM) provides plausibility scores for atomic predicates in one decoding-free forward pass, from which a probabilistic reasoning engine derives the posterior probability of query satisfaction. We evaluate OrLog across multiple backbone LLMs, varying levels of access to external knowledge, and a range of logical constraints, and compare it against base retrievers and LLM-as-reasoner methods. Provided with entity descriptions, OrLog can significantly boost top-rank precision compared to LLM reasoning with larger gains on disjunctive queries. OrLog is also more efficient, cutting mean tokens by $\\sim$90\\% per query-entity pair. These results demonstrate that generation-free predicate plausibility estimation combined with probabilistic reasoning enables constraint-aware retrieval that outperforms monolithic reasoning while using far fewer tokens.", "AI": {"tldr": "OrLog\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u68c0\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8c13\u8bcd\u7ea7\u5408\u7406\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u539f\u5b50\u8c13\u8bcd\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u7387\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u8ba1\u7b97\u67e5\u8be2\u6ee1\u8db3\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ea6\u675f\u611f\u77e5\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u8981\u4e48\u5ffd\u7565\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u4e0e\u3001\u6216\u3001\u975e\uff09\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u9002\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5f62\u5f0f\u903b\u8f91\u6216\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u67e5\u8be2\u65e0\u6b67\u4e49\u4e14\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u5b8c\u6574\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u5f88\u5c11\u6ee1\u8db3\u3002", "method": "OrLog\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u6b21\u65e0\u89e3\u7801\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u9012\u4e3a\u539f\u5b50\u8c13\u8bcd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5408\u7406\u6027\u5206\u6570\uff1b2\uff09\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5206\u6570\u8f93\u5165\u6982\u7387\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u67e5\u8be2\u6ee1\u8db3\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u6982\u7387\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u8c13\u8bcd\u7ea7\u5408\u7406\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u89e3\u8026\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9aa8\u5e72LLM\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bbf\u95ee\u7ea7\u522b\u548c\u5404\u79cd\u903b\u8f91\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff1a1\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u4f53\u63cf\u8ff0\u65f6\uff0cOrLog\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9876\u7ea7\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6790\u53d6\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0a\u4f18\u52bf\u66f4\u5927\uff1b2\uff09\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u67e5\u8be2-\u5b9e\u4f53\u5bf9\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea690%\u7684token\u4f7f\u7528\uff1b3\uff09\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u548cLLM-as-reasoner\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65e0\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8c13\u8bcd\u5408\u7406\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u7ed3\u5408\u6982\u7387\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ea6\u675f\u611f\u77e5\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5728\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u4fe1\u606f\u9700\u6c42\u4e2d\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u7ea6\u675f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

For each target word and time slice, we induce a word-centered semantic network that integrates distributional similarity from diachronic Skip-gram embeddings with lexical substitutability from time-specific masked language models. We identify sense-related structure by clustering the peripheral graph, align clusters across time via node overlap, and track change through cluster composition and normalized cluster mass. In an application study on a corpus of New York Times Magazine articles (1980 - 2017), we show that graph connectivity reflects polysemy dynamics and that the induced communities capture contrasting trajectories: event-driven sense replacement (trump), semantic stability with cluster over-segmentation effects (god), and gradual association shifts tied to digital communication (post). Overall, word-centered semantic graphs offer a compact and transparent representation for exploring sense evolution without relying on predefined sense inventories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u5386\u65f6\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u8bcd\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8bed\u4e49\u7f51\u7edc\u6765\u8ffd\u8e2a\u8bcd\u4e49\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6f14\u53d8\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u8bcd\u4e49\u6e05\u5355\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u900f\u660e\u3001\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6355\u6349\u8bcd\u4e49\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u8bcd\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5207\u7247\u6784\u5efa\u8bcd\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8bed\u4e49\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5386\u65f6Skip-gram\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u63a9\u7801\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u53ef\u66ff\u6362\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u5916\u56f4\u56fe\u8bc6\u522b\u8bcd\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8282\u70b9\u91cd\u53e0\u5bf9\u9f50\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u7ec4\u6210\u548c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u805a\u7c7b\u8d28\u91cf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u300a\u7ebd\u7ea6\u65f6\u62a5\u6742\u5fd7\u300b\u6587\u7ae0\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff081980-2017\uff09\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u56fe\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u591a\u4e49\u6027\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u793e\u533a\u6355\u6349\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bcd\u4e49\u66ff\u6362\uff08trump\uff09\u3001\u5177\u6709\u805a\u7c7b\u8fc7\u5206\u5272\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff08god\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0e\u6570\u5b57\u901a\u4fe1\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u9010\u6e10\u5173\u8054\u53d8\u5316\uff08post\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bcd\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8bed\u4e49\u56fe\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7d27\u51d1\u900f\u660e\u7684\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63a2\u7d22\u8bcd\u4e49\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u8bcd\u4e49\u6e05\u5355\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002"}}

We present the first systematic investigation of experience faithfulness, the causal dependence of an agent's decisions on the experience it is given, in self-evolving LLM agents. Using controlled causal interventions on both raw and condensed forms of experience, we comprehensively evaluate four representative frameworks across 10 LLM backbones and 9 environments. Our analysis uncovers a striking asymmetry: while agents consistently depend on raw experience, they often disregard or misinterpret condensed experience, even when it is the only experience provided. This gap persists across single- and multi-agent configurations and across backbone scales. We trace its underlying causes to three factors: the semantic limitations of condensed content, internal processing biases that suppress experience, and task regimes where pretrained priors already suffice. These findings challenge prevailing assumptions about self-evolving methods and underscore the need for more faithful and reliable approaches to experience integration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u65f6\u5bf9\u539f\u59cb\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5177\u6709\u56e0\u679c\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u6d53\u7f29\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5374\u5e38\u5e38\u5ffd\u89c6\u6216\u8bef\u89e3\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u901a\u8fc7\u79ef\u7d2f\u548c\u91cd\u7528\u8fc7\u53bb\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e0d\u65ad\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u5b83\u4eec\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u4f9d\u8d56\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u8c03\u67e5\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e2d\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u5bf9\u539f\u59cb\u548c\u6d53\u7f29\u4e24\u79cd\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u6db5\u76d6\u4e864\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u300110\u4e2aLLM\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u548c9\u4e2a\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u914d\u7f6e\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff1a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f9d\u8d56\u539f\u59cb\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f46\u7ecf\u5e38\u5ffd\u89c6\u6216\u8bef\u89e3\u6d53\u7f29\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u8fd9\u662f\u552f\u4e00\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u5dee\u8ddd\u5728\u5355/\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e2d\u90fd\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u79cd\u5dee\u8ddd\u6e90\u4e8e\u4e09\u4e2a\u56e0\u7d20\uff1a\u6d53\u7f29\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u9650\u5236\u3001\u6291\u5236\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u5904\u7406\u504f\u89c1\u4ee5\u53ca\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5148\u9a8c\u5df2\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u673a\u5236\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u666e\u904d\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5fe0\u5b9e\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6574\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Through experiments with a character-level language model, we demonstrate that this method significantly improves performance on low-resource language validation data.

However, existing methods typically employ binary rewards that fail to capture quality differences among trajectories achieving identical outcomes, thereby overlooking potential diversity within the solution space. Inspired by the ``sweet spot'' concept in tennis-the racket's core region that produces optimal hitting effects, we introduce \\textbf{S}weet \\textbf{S}pot \\textbf{L}earning (\\textbf{SSL}), a novel framework that provides differentiated guidance for agent optimization. SSL follows a simple yet effective principle: progressively amplified, tiered rewards guide policies toward the sweet-spot region of the solution space. This principle naturally adapts across diverse tasks: visual perception tasks leverage distance-tiered modeling to reward proximity, while complex reasoning tasks reward incremental progress toward promising solutions. We theoretically demonstrate that SSL preserves optimal solution ordering and enhances the gradient signal-to-noise ratio, thereby fostering more directed optimization. Extensive experiments across GUI perception, short/long-term planning, and complex reasoning tasks show consistent improvements over strong baselines on 12 benchmarks, achieving up to 2.5X sample efficiency gains and effective cross-task transferability.

While reinforcement learning can help, progress has been limited by two structural bottlenecks: existing open-source agentic training data are narrow in task variety and easily solved; real-world APIs lack diversity and are unstable for large-scale reinforcement learning rollout processes. We address these challenges with SYNTHAGENT, a framework that jointly synthesizes diverse tool-use training data and simulates complete environments. Specifically, a strong teacher model creates novel tasks and tool ecosystems, then rewrites them into intentionally underspecified instructions. This compels agents to actively query users for missing details. When handling synthetic tasks, an LLM-based user simulator provides user-private information, while a mock tool system delivers stable tool responses. For rewards, task-level rubrics are constructed based on required subgoals, user-agent interactions, and forbidden behaviors.

While GMPO improves stability by constraining a conservative objective, it shares a fundamental limitation with GRPO: reliance on a fixed aggregation geometry that ignores the evolving and heterogeneous nature of each trajectory. In this work, we unify these approaches under Power-Mean Policy Optimization (PMPO), a generalized framework that parameterizes the aggregation geometry via the power-mean geometry exponent p. Within this framework, GRPO and GMPO are recovered as special cases. Theoretically, we demonstrate that adjusting p modulates the concentration of gradient updates, effectively reweighting tokens based on their advantage contribution. To determine p adaptively, we introduce a Clip-aware Effective Sample Size (ESS) mechanism. Specifically, we propose a deterministic rule that maps a trajectory clipping fraction to a target ESS. Then, we solve for the specific p to align the trajectory induced ESS with this target one. This allows PMPO to dynamically transition between the aggressive arithmetic mean for reliable trajectories and the conservative geometric mean for unstable ones. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PMPO outperforms strong baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "PMPO\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e42\u5e73\u5747\u51e0\u4f55\u53c2\u6570p\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86GRPO\u548cGMPO\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u88c1\u526a\u611f\u77e5\u6709\u6548\u6837\u672c\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94p\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982GRPO\u548cGMPO\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u5c40\u9650\uff1a\u5b83\u4eec\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u805a\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPower-Mean Policy Optimization (PMPO)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e42\u5e73\u5747\u51e0\u4f55\u6307\u6570p\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u805a\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5c06GRPO\u548cGMPO\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3a\u7279\u4f8b\u3002\u5f15\u5165Clip-aware Effective Sample Size (ESS)\u673a\u5236\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u786e\u5b9ap\u503c\uff1a\u63d0\u51fa\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u89c4\u5219\u5c06\u8f68\u8ff9\u88c1\u526a\u6bd4\u4f8b\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u76ee\u6807ESS\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u6c42\u89e3\u7279\u5b9a\u7684p\u503c\u4f7f\u8f68\u8ff9\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684ESS\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807ESS\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cPMPO\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u8c03\u6574p\u53ef\u4ee5\u8c03\u8282\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u96c6\u4e2d\u5ea6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6839\u636e\u4f18\u52bf\u8d21\u732e\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u6743\u6807\u8bb0\u3002", "conclusion": "PMPO\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6fc0\u8fdb\u7b97\u672f\u5e73\u5747\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u4fdd\u5b88\u51e0\u4f55\u5e73\u5747\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fc7\u6e21\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u56fa\u5b9a\u805a\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

To address this, we study the denoising dynamics and find that the implicit density ($\u03c1$) of end-of-sequence ($\\texttt{EOS}$) tokens serves as a reliable signal of generation sufficiency. In particular, the evolving implicit $\\texttt{EOS}$ density during denoising reveals whether the current masked space is excessive or insufficient, thereby guiding the adjustment direction for generation length. Building on this insight, we propose $\\textbf{$\u03c1$-$\\texttt{EOS}$}$, a training-free, single-stage strategy that enables bidirectional variable-length generation for masked dLLMs. Unlike prior two-stage approaches--which require separate length adjustment and iterative mask insertion phases while supporting only unidirectional expansion--$\\textbf{$\u03c1$-$\\texttt{EOS}$}$ achieves bidirectional length adjustment within a unified denoising process by continuously estimating the implicit $\\texttt{EOS}$ density: excessively high density triggers $\\texttt{MASK}$ token contraction, while insufficient density induces expansion.

We name this phenomenon the Holographic Characteristic of language models. For the purpose of exploring this characteristic and further improving the inference efficiency of language models, we propose a plugin called HOLO, which leverages the Holographic Characteristic to extract target-side keywords from language models within a limited number of generation steps and complements the sentence with a parallel lexically constrained text generation method. To verify the effectiveness of HOLO, we conduct massive experiments on language models of varying architectures and scales in the short-text generation scenario.

However, it is difficult to disentangle which evaluation biases are explained by narcissism versus general experimental confounds, distorting measurements of self-preference bias. We discover a core methodological confound which could reduce measurement error by 89.6%. Specifically, LLM evaluators may deliver self-preferring verdicts when the judge responds to queries which they completed incorrectly themselves; this would be true regardless of whether one of their responses is their own. To decouple self-preference signals from noisy outputs on hard problems, we introduce an Evaluator Quality Baseline, which compares the probability that a judge incorrectly votes for itself against the probability that it votes for an incorrect response from another model. Evaluating this simple baseline on 37,448 queries, only 51% of initial findings retain statistical significance. Finally, we turn towards characterizing the entropy of \"easy\" versus \"hard\" evaluation votes from LLM judges. Our corrective baseline enables future research on self-preference by eliminating noisy data from potential solutions.

A critical design choice is the placement of normalization layers, leading to a fundamental trade-off: the ``PreNorm'' architecture ensures training stability at the cost of potential performance degradation in deep models, while the ``PostNorm'' architecture offers strong performance but suffers from severe training instability. In this work, we propose SpanNorm, a novel technique designed to resolve this dilemma by integrating the strengths of both paradigms. Structurally, SpanNorm establishes a clean residual connection that spans the entire transformer block to stabilize signal propagation, while employing a PostNorm-style computation that normalizes the aggregated output to enhance model performance. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that SpanNorm, combined with a principled scaling strategy, maintains bounded signal variance throughout the network, preventing the gradient issues that plague PostNorm models, and also alleviating the representation collapse of PreNorm. Empirically, SpanNorm consistently outperforms standard normalization schemes in both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) scenarios, paving the way for more powerful and stable Transformer architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "SpanNorm\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684Transformer\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86PreNorm\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548cPostNorm\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u8d8a\u6574\u4e2aTransformer\u5757\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u548cPostNorm\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u56f0\u5883\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dTransformer\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5c42\u7684\u653e\u7f6e\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u6743\u8861\uff1aPreNorm\u67b6\u6784\u786e\u4fdd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u800cPostNorm\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f3a\u6027\u80fd\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u56f0\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSpanNorm\u6280\u672f\uff1a1\uff09\u5efa\u7acb\u8de8\u8d8a\u6574\u4e2aTransformer\u5757\u7684\u5e72\u51c0\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u4ee5\u7a33\u5b9a\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u64ad\uff1b2\uff09\u91c7\u7528PostNorm\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6765\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u805a\u5408\u8f93\u51fa\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff1b3\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u6709\u539f\u5219\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u4fdd\u6301\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u754c\u4fe1\u53f7\u65b9\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660eSpanNorm\u80fd\u9632\u6b62PostNorm\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3PreNorm\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5d29\u6e83\u3002\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4e0a\uff0cSpanNorm\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08MoE\uff09\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u90fd\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "SpanNorm\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5c42\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86PreNorm\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548cPostNorm\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

In this work, we investigate whether smaller models can serve as efficient evaluators by leveraging internal representations instead of surface generation. We uncover a consistent empirical pattern: small LMs, despite with weak generative ability, encode rich evaluative signals in their hidden states. This motivates us to propose the Semantic Capacity Asymmetry Hypothesis: evaluation requires significantly less semantic capacity than generation and can be grounded in intermediate representations, suggesting that evaluation does not necessarily need to rely on large-scale generative models but can instead leverage latent features from smaller ones. Our findings motivate a paradigm shift from LLM-as-a-Judge to Representation-as-a-Judge, a decoding-free evaluation strategy that probes internal model structure rather than relying on prompted output. We instantiate this paradigm through INSPECTOR, a probing-based framework that predicts aspect-level evaluation scores from small model representations. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH, GPQA) show that INSPECTOR substantially outperforms prompting-based small LMs and closely approximates full LLM judges, while offering a more efficient, reliable, and interpretable alternative for scalable evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\"Representation-as-a-Judge\"\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7INSPECTOR\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\"LLM-as-a-Judge\"\u8303\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u3001\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u654f\u611f\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5c3d\u7ba1\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u5305\u542b\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u8fd9\u542f\u53d1\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u800c\u975e\u8868\u9762\u751f\u6210\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8bed\u4e49\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5047\u8bbe\uff1a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6240\u9700\u8bed\u4e49\u80fd\u529b\u8fdc\u5c0f\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u5f81\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51faINSPECTOR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u9488\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ece\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u5f81\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u89e3\u7801\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728GSM8K\u3001MATH\u3001GPQA\u7b49\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cINSPECTOR\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u6574LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u5305\u542b\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u9700\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3002INSPECTOR\u6846\u67b6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86Representation-as-a-Judge\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing safety datasets are predominantly English centric, limiting progress in multilingual safety alignment. As a result, low resource expert models, finetuned on their respective instruction datasets, tend to exhibit higher unsafety rates compared to their high resource counterparts. In this work, we propose a safety aware layer swapping method that transfers safety alignment from an English safety expert to low resource language experts without additional training.

Existing pruning methods suffer from two primary limitations. First, reliance on dataset-specific calibration introduces significant data dependency and computational overhead. Second, being predominantly static, they fail to account for the evolving subset of knowledge neurons in LLMs during autoregressive generation as the context evolves. To address this, we introduce DART, i.e., Dynamic Attention-Guided Runtime Tracing), a lightweight, training-free method that performs on-the-fly context-based pruning. DART monitors shifts in attention score distributions to infer context changes, dynamically updating neuron-level masks to retain salient parameters. Across ten benchmarks, DART outperforms prior dynamic baseline, achieving accuracy gains of up to 14.5% on LLAMA-3.1-8B at 70% FFN sparsity. Furthermore, DART achieves up to 3x better ROUGE-L scores with respect to static-masked pruning on summarization tasks, with its performance comparable to the original dense models. We conclusively demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively adapts to diverse semantic contexts, preserves model capabilities across both general and domain-specific tasks while running at less than 10MBs of memory for LLAMA-3.1-8B(16GBs) with 0.1% FLOPs overhead.

By segregating structural encoding from semantic processing, these systems must perform a complex implicit alignment between abstract graph tokens and concrete textual elements. Challenging the necessity of external encoders, we propose NAG (Native Architecture for Graphs), a unified framework that internalizes graph processing within the LM's native manifold. Instead of bridging disparate embedding spaces, NAG repurposes the self-attention mechanism to enforce topological dependencies and recalibrates positional IDs to ensure structural equivalence. This allows the model to harness its intrinsic linguistic capability to simultaneously comprehend node and edge content alongside structural topology. We introduce two efficient implementations: NAG-Zero for absolute preservation of the base model's linguistic capabilities, and NAG-LoRA for enhanced structural adaptation. Experiments across diverse graph tasks validate that NAG achieves robust graph comprehension without the overhead of external encoders, offering a simpler, more coherent paradigm for text-graph modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "NAG\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u56fe\u5904\u7406\u5185\u5316\u5230\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u539f\u751f\u6d41\u5f62\u4e2d\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8GNN\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u9020\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6eID\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u79bb\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u5916\u90e8GNN\u7f16\u7801\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u6587\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u56fe\u6765\u8bf4\u662f\u6b21\u4f18\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0a\u8131\u8282\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u62bd\u8c61\u56fe\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u5177\u4f53\u6587\u672c\u5143\u7d20\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u590d\u6742\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86NAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6765\u5f3a\u5236\u62d3\u6251\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u6821\u51c6\u4f4d\u7f6eID\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u7ed3\u6784\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1aNAG-Zero\uff08\u7edd\u5bf9\u4fdd\u7559\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\uff09\u548cNAG-LoRA\uff08\u589e\u5f3a\u7ed3\u6784\u9002\u5e94\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u56fe\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86NAG\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u56fe\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u56fe\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "NAG\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5916\u90e8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528\u5176\u5185\u5728\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u540c\u65f6\u7406\u89e3\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u8fb9\u5185\u5bb9\u4ee5\u53ca\u7ed3\u6784\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u56fe\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Consequently, preventing unauthorized appropriation of open-source LLMs and protecting developers' intellectual property rights have become critical challenges. In this work, we propose the Functional Network Fingerprint (FNF), a training-free, sample-efficient method for detecting whether a suspect LLM is derived from a victim model, based on the consistency between their functional network activity. We demonstrate that models that share a common origin, even with differences in scale or architecture, exhibit highly consistent patterns of neuronal activity within their functional networks across diverse input samples. In contrast, models trained independently on distinct data or with different objectives fail to preserve such activity alignment. Unlike conventional approaches, our method requires only a few samples for verification, preserves model utility, and remains robust to common model modifications (such as fine-tuning, pruning, and parameter permutation), as well as to comparisons across diverse architectures and dimensionalities.

To address these inconsistencies, a dynamic format-alignment strategy is introduced that employs a lightweight classifier trained on latent model-preference signals.

The proposed method achieves substantial and consistent improvements in zero-shot accuracy across reasoning and knowledge benchmarks, better revealing the models' latent capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9009\u62e9\u9898\u683c\u5f0f\uff08\u7b26\u53f7\u5f0fvs\u5b8c\u5f62\u586b\u7a7a\u5f0f\uff09\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u597d\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u683c\u5f0f\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u5f0f\u548c\u5b8c\u5f62\u586b\u7a7a\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u9898\u8bc4\u4f30\u683c\u5f0f\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5dee\u5f02\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u771f\u5b9e\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u683c\u5f0f\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u683c\u5f0f\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u6f5c\u5728\u504f\u597d\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u5b9e\u4f8b\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u4f18\u8bc4\u4f30\u683c\u5f0f\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u800c\u975e\u4eba\u5de5\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u4e14\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6539\u8fdb\u6548\u679c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89e3\u7801\u5668LLMs\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9009\u62e9\u9898\u683c\u5f0f\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u5177\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u504f\u597d\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u683c\u5f0f\u5bf9\u9f50\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Recent speech large language models (Speech LLMs) have substantially improved SST quality, yet they still struggle to correctly translate rare and domain-specific terminology. While retrieval augmentation has been effective for terminology translation in machine translation, bringing retrieval to SST is non-trivial: it requires fast and accurate cross-modal (speech-to-text) retrieval under partial, continually arriving input, and the model must decide whether and when to apply retrieved terms during incremental generation. We propose Retrieval-Augmented Simultaneous Speech Translation (RASST), which tightly integrates cross-modal retrieval into the SST pipeline. RASST trains a lightweight speech-text retriever and performs efficient sliding-window retrieval, providing chunkwise terminology hints to the Speech LLM. We further synthesize training data that teaches the Speech LLM to leverage retrieved terms precisely.

A Mechanistic Estimation of Computation Density in Transformer-based LLMs", "comment": null, "summary": "Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) are comprised of billions of parameters arranged in deep and wide computational graphs. Several studies on LLM efficiency optimization argue that it is possible to prune a significant portion of the parameters, while only marginally impacting performance. This suggests that the computation is not uniformly distributed across the parameters. We introduce here a technique to systematically quantify computation density in LLMs. In particular, we design a density estimator drawing on mechanistic interpretability. We experimentally test our estimator and find that: (1) contrary to what has been often assumed, LLM processing generally involves dense computation; (2) computation density is dynamic, in the sense that models shift between sparse and dense processing regimes depending on the input; (3) per-input density is significantly correlated across LLMs, suggesting that the same inputs trigger either low or high density. Investigating the factors influencing density, we observe that predicting rarer tokens requires higher density, and increasing context length often decreases the density. We believe that our computation density estimator will contribute to a better understanding of the processing at work in LLMs, challenging their symbolic interpretation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u91cf\u5316LLM\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u5904\u7406\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u5bc6\u96c6\u8ba1\u7b97\u800c\u975e\u7a00\u758f\u7684\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u5ea6\u662f\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u5185\u5bb9\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9LLM\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u53ef\u4ee5\u5927\u91cf\u526a\u679d\u53c2\u6570\u800c\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u8d28\u7591\u8ba1\u7b97\u662f\u5426\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u4e2d\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u91cf\u5316LLM\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8be5\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u6765\u91cf\u5316LLM\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09LLM\u5904\u7406\u901a\u5e38\u6d89\u53ca\u5bc6\u96c6\u8ba1\u7b97\u800c\u975e\u7a00\u758f\u8ba1\u7b97\uff1b2\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u5ea6\u662f\u52a8\u6001\u7684\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6839\u636e\u8f93\u5165\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u95f4\u5207\u6362\uff1b3\uff09\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u4e2d\u76f8\u540c\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\uff1b4\uff09\u9884\u6d4b\u7f55\u89c1token\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u901a\u5e38\u964d\u4f4e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u597d\u7406\u89e3LLM\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u89e3\u91ca\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8ba1\u7b97\u662f\u5bc6\u96c6\u4e14\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u3002"}}

Recent studies have found that LLMs process multilingual inputs in shared concept spaces, thought to support generalization and cross-lingual transfer. However, these prior studies often do not use causal methods, lack deeper error analysis or focus on the final model only, leaving open how these spaces emerge during training. We investigate the development of language-agnostic concept spaces during pretraining of EuroLLM through the causal interpretability method of activation patching. We isolate cross-lingual concept representations, then inject them into a translation prompt to investigate how consistently translations can be altered, independently of the language. We find that shared concept spaces emerge early} and continue to refine, but that alignment with them is language-dependent}. Furthermore, in contrast to prior work, our fine-grained manual analysis reveals that some apparent gains in translation quality reflect shifts in behavior -- like selecting senses for polysemous words or translating instead of copying cross-lingual homographs -- rather than improved translation ability.

This makes linguistically deep annotation difficult and complicates fine-grained analyses aimed at understanding why and how learners produce specific errors. To address these limitations, this paper presents a semi-automated annotation methodology for learner corpora, built upon a recently proposed faceted taxonomy, and implemented through a novel annotation extension framework. The taxonomy provides a theoretically grounded, multi-dimensional categorization that captures the linguistic properties underlying each error instance, thereby enabling standardized, fine-grained, and interpretable enrichment beyond flat annotations. The annotation extension tool, implemented based on the proposed extension framework for Turkish, automatically extends existing flat annotations by inferring additional linguistic and metadata information as facets within the taxonomy to provide richer learner-specific context. It was systematically evaluated and yielded promising performance results, achieving a facet-level accuracy of 95.86%. The resulting taxonomically enriched corpus offers enhanced querying capabilities and supports detailed exploratory analyses across learner corpora, enabling researchers to investigate error patterns through complex linguistic and pedagogical dimensions. This work introduces the first collaboratively annotated and taxonomically enriched Turkish Learner Corpus, a manual annotation guideline with a refined tagset, and an annotation extender.

Despite T\u00fcrkiye's significant role in the global workforce, Turkish, a morphologically complex language, lacks both a skill taxonomy and a dedicated skill extraction dataset, resulting in underexplored research in skill extraction for Turkish. This article seeks the answers to three research questions: 1) How can skill extraction be effectively performed for this language, in light of its low resource nature? 2)~What is the most promising model? 3) What is the impact of different Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompting strategies on skill extraction (i.e., dynamic vs. static few-shot samples, varying context information, and encouraging causal reasoning)? The article introduces the first Turkish skill extraction dataset and performance evaluations of automated skill extraction using LLMs. The manually annotated dataset contains 4,819 labeled skill spans from 327 job postings across different occupation areas. The use of LLM outperforms supervised sequence labeling when used in an end-to-end pipeline, aligning extracted spans with standardized skills in the ESCO taxonomy more effectively. The best-performing configuration, utilizing Claude Sonnet 3.7 with dynamic few-shot prompting for skill identification, embedding-based retrieval, and LLM-based reranking for skill linking, achieves an end-to-end performance of 0.56, positioning Turkish alongside similar studies in other languages, which are few in the literature. Our findings suggest that LLMs can improve skill extraction performance in low-resource settings, and we hope that our work will accelerate similar research on skill extraction for underrepresented languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u4e3a\u571f\u8033\u5176\u8bed\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u6280\u80fd\u62bd\u53d6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86LLM\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u6280\u80fd\u62bd\u53d6\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0Claude Sonnet 3.7\u914d\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u571f\u8033\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5168\u7403\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u91cd\u8981\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\uff0c\u5176\u8bed\u8a00\u571f\u8033\u5176\u8bed\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6280\u80fd\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\u548c\u4e13\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u571f\u8033\u5176\u8bed\u6280\u80fd\u62bd\u53d6\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u4e09\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1)\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u8fdb\u884c\u571f\u8033\u5176\u8bed\u6280\u80fd\u62bd\u53d6\uff1b2)\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1b3)\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u571f\u8033\u5176\u8bed\u6280\u80fd\u62bd\u53d6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff084,819\u4e2a\u6807\u6ce8\u6280\u80fd\u8de8\u5ea6\uff0c\u6765\u81ea327\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u804c\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u62db\u8058\u5e7f\u544a\uff09\u3002\u91c7\u7528LLM\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e0d\u540cLLM\uff08\u5305\u62ecClaude Sonnet 3.7\uff09\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u52a8\u6001vs\u9759\u6001\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u6fc0\u52b1\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u548cLLM\u91cd\u6392\u8fdb\u884c\u6280\u80fd\u94fe\u63a5\u3002", "result": "LLM\u5728\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u5e8f\u5217\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5c06\u62bd\u53d6\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u8de8\u5ea6\u4e0eESCO\u5206\u7c7b\u6807\u51c6\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u6700\u4f73\u914d\u7f6e\uff08Claude Sonnet 3.7 + \u52a8\u6001\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a + \u5d4c\u5165\u68c0\u7d22 + LLM\u91cd\u6392\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e860.56\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f7f\u571f\u8033\u5176\u8bed\u6280\u80fd\u62bd\u53d6\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u8bed\u8a00\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u62bd\u53d6\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u571f\u8033\u5176\u8bed\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0d\u8db3\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u62bd\u53d6\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u52a0\u901f\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Building Dialect-Accurate Dialog[ue]s Beyond the American Default with MDial", "comment": null, "summary": "More than 80% of the 1.6 billion English speakers do not use Standard American English (SAE) and experience higher failure rates and stereotyped responses when interacting with LLMs as a result. Yet multi-dialectal performance remains underexplored. We introduce $\\textbf{MDial}$, the first large-scale framework for generating multi-dialectal conversational data encompassing the three pillars of written dialect -- lexical (vocabulary), orthographic (spelling), and morphosyntactic (grammar) features -- for nine English dialects. Partnering with native linguists, we design an annotated and scalable rule-based LLM transformation to ensure precision. Our approach challenges the assumption that models should mirror users' morphosyntactic features, showing that up to 90% of the grammatical features of a dialect should not be reproduced by models. Independent evaluations confirm data quality, with annotators preferring MDial outputs over prior methods in 98% of pairwise comparisons for dialect naturalness.

However, despite their ubiquitous use, the exact mechanisms underlying their outstanding performance remain unclear. Different methods for LLM explainability exist, and many are, as a method, not fully understood themselves. We started with the question of how linguistic abstraction emerges in LLMs, aiming to detect it across different LLM modules (attention heads and input embeddings). For this, we used methods well-established in the literature: (1) probing for token-level relational structures, and (2) feature-mapping using embeddings as carriers of human-interpretable properties.\n  Both attempts failed for different methodological reasons: Attention-based explanations collapsed once we tested the core assumption that later-layer representations still correspond to tokens. Property-inference methods applied to embeddings also failed because their high predictive scores were driven by methodological artifacts and dataset structure rather than meaningful semantic knowledge. These failures matter because both techniques are widely treated as evidence for what LLMs supposedly understand, yet our results show such conclusions are unwarranted.

Specifically, we identify two primary obstacles: (1) data scarcity, as high-quality parallel data requires bilingual annotators familiar with platform-specific slang, and stylistic cues in both languages; and (2) metric limitations, where traditional evaluators like COMET often fail to capture stylistic fidelity and nonstandard expressions. To bridge these gaps, we introduce CSM-MTBench, a benchmark covering five Chinese-foreign language directions and consisting of two expert-curated subsets: Fun Posts, featuring context-rich, slang- and neologism-heavy content, and Social Snippets, emphasizing concise, emotion- and style- driven expressions.

Although they achieve competitive performance on several tasks, a substantial gap remains in open-ended text generation. We hypothesize that one cause of this gap is that strict positional prediction makes MDLM decoding highly sensitive to token misalignment, and we show through controlled interventions that a one-position shift can severely disrupt semantics. This observation suggests that enforcing strict positional supervision during training is misaligned with the irreversible denoising dynamics of MDLM decoding. Motivated by this mismatch, we adopt an alignment-flexible supervision strategy during fine-tuning. Specifically, we introduce a special token <slack> via the connectionist temporal classification objective. We apply this approach to the widely used MDLM model and conduct experiments on five open-ended text generation benchmarks.

To address the limitations of predefined prompts, we introduce a fraud-aware selective CoT distillation mechanism that generates diverse reasoning paths and enhances semantic-structural understanding.

Furthermore, we develop an efficient asymmetric co-training strategy that enables end-to-end optimization while significantly reducing the computational cost of naive joint training.

However, state-of-the-art block-wise dLLMs rely on a \"remasking\" mechanism that decodes only the most confident tokens and discards the rest, effectively wasting computation. We demonstrate that recycling computation from the discarded tokens is beneficial, as these tokens retain contextual information useful for subsequent decoding iterations. In light of this, we propose Residual Context Diffusion (RCD), a module that converts these discarded token representations into contextual residuals and injects them back for the next denoising step. RCD uses a decoupled two-stage training pipeline to bypass the memory bottlenecks associated with backpropagation. We validate our method on both long CoT reasoning (SDAR) and short CoT instruction following (LLaDA) models. We demonstrate that a standard dLLM can be efficiently converted to the RCD paradigm with merely ~1 billion tokens. RCD consistently improves frontier dLLMs by 5-10 points in accuracy with minimal extra computation overhead across a wide range of benchmarks.

We hypothesize that these outliers, in conjunction with the corresponding normalizations (\\textit{e.g.}, softmax attention and RMSNorm), effectively rescale other non-outlier components. We term this phenomenon \\textit{outlier-driven rescaling} and validate this hypothesis across different model architectures and training token counts. This view unifies the origin and mitigation of both sink types. Our main conclusions and observations include: (1) Outliers function jointly with normalization: removing normalization eliminates the corresponding outliers but degrades training stability and performance; directly clipping outliers while retaining normalization leads to degradation, indicating that outlier-driven rescaling contributes to training stability. (2) Outliers serve more as rescale factors rather than contributors, as the final contributions of attention and residual sinks are significantly smaller than those of non-outliers. (3) Outliers can be absorbed into learnable parameters or mitigated via explicit gated rescaling, leading to improved training performance (average gain of 2 points) and enhanced quantization robustness (1.2 points degradation under W4A4 quantization).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\uff08\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6c47\u805a\u70b9\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u6c47\u805a\u70b9\uff09\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u4e0e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u64cd\u4f5c\u5171\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u91cd\u7f29\u653e\u73b0\u8c61\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u73b0\u8c61\uff1a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6c47\u805a\u70b9\uff08\u5c11\u6570token\u6301\u7eed\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6570\uff09\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u6c47\u805a\u70b9\uff08\u5c11\u6570\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570token\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u5927\u6fc0\u6d3b\u503c\uff09\u3002\u63a2\u7d22\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u89d2\u8272\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\"\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u91cd\u7f29\u653e\"\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3token\u6570\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u79fb\u9664\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u3001\u76f4\u63a5\u88c1\u526a\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u5438\u6536\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u6216\u4f7f\u7528\u663e\u5f0f\u95e8\u63a7\u91cd\u7f29\u653e\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u4e0e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u64cd\u4f5c\u5171\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff1a\u79fb\u9664\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u4f1a\u6d88\u9664\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u4f46\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u76f4\u63a5\u88c1\u526a\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u4e5f\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u4e3b\u8981\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cd\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\u800c\u975e\u4e3b\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u8005\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u5e73\u57472\u70b9\u589e\u76ca\uff09\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u91cf\u5316\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff08W4A4\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\u4ec51.2\u70b9\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u91cd\u7f29\u653e\u73b0\u8c61\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u4e0e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u4e3b\u8981\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cd\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\u800c\u975e\u4e3b\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u8005\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u5438\u6536\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u6216\u4f7f\u7528\u95e8\u63a7\u91cd\u7f29\u653e\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Despite growing attention to political bias in LLMs, prior work largely focuses on high-resource, Western languages or narrow multilingual settings, leaving cross-lingual consistency and safe post-hoc mitigation underexplored. To address this gap, we present a large-scale multilingual evaluation of political bias spanning 50 countries and 33 languages. We introduce a complementary post-hoc mitigation framework, Cross-Lingual Alignment Steering (CLAS), designed to augment existing steering methods by aligning ideological representations across languages and dynamically regulating intervention strength.

We introduce InstructDiff, a unified framework that operationalizes differential entropy as a domain-adaptive selection criterion through warmup calibration, bi-directional NLL filtering, and entropy-based ranking.

However, existing ABSA research relies on coarse-grained categorical labels (e.g., positive, negative), which limits its ability to capture nuanced affective states. To address this limitation, we adopt a dimensional approach that represents sentiment with continuous valence-arousal (VA) scores, enabling fine-grained analysis at both the aspect and sentiment levels. To this end, we introduce DimABSA, the first multilingual, dimensional ABSA resource annotated with both traditional ABSA elements (aspect terms, aspect categories, and opinion terms) and newly introduced VA scores. This resource contains 76,958 aspect instances across 42,590 sentences, spanning six languages and four domains. We further introduce three subtasks that combine VA scores with different ABSA elements, providing a bridge from traditional ABSA to dimensional ABSA. Given that these subtasks involve both categorical and continuous outputs, we propose a new unified metric, continuous F1 (cF1), which incorporates VA prediction error into standard F1. We provide a comprehensive benchmark using both prompted and fine-tuned large language models across all subtasks.

Prior explanations mainly attribute this phenomenon to the generalization of erroneous or unsafe content. In this work, we show that this view is incomplete. Across multiple domains and model families, we find that fine-tuning models on data exhibiting specific character-level dispositions induces substantially stronger and more transferable misalignment than incorrect-advice fine-tuning, while largely preserving general capabilities. This indicates that emergent misalignment arises from stable shifts in model behavior rather than from capability degradation or corrupted knowledge. We further show that such behavioral dispositions can be conditionally activated by both training-time triggers and inference-time persona-aligned prompts, revealing shared structure across emergent misalignment, backdoor activation, and jailbreak susceptibility. Overall, our results identify character formation as a central and underexplored alignment risk, suggesting that robust alignment must address behavioral dispositions rather than isolated errors or prompt-level defenses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5fae\u8c03LLMs\u65f6\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6570\u636e\u5185\u5bb9\u6b63\u786e\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u884c\u4e3a\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u4e5f\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u8fd9\u6e90\u4e8e\u884c\u4e3a\u503e\u5411\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u8f6c\u53d8\u800c\u975e\u80fd\u529b\u9000\u5316", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u6d8c\u73b0\u9519\u4f4d\u4e3b\u8981\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u9519\u8bef\u6216\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u672c\u6587\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u79cd\u89c2\u70b9\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u6df1\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u539f\u56e0", "method": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c55\u73b0\u7279\u5b9a\u5b57\u7b26\u7ea7\u503e\u5411\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u9519\u8bef\u5efa\u8bae\u5fae\u8c03\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u884c\u4e3a\u503e\u5411\u7684\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u673a\u5236", "result": "\u5b57\u7b26\u7ea7\u503e\u5411\u5fae\u8c03\u6bd4\u9519\u8bef\u5efa\u8bae\u5fae\u8c03\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u5f3a\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u9519\u4f4d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u822c\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u884c\u4e3a\u503e\u5411\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u89d2\u8272\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u793a\u6761\u4ef6\u6fc0\u6d3b", "conclusion": "\u6d8c\u73b0\u9519\u4f4d\u6e90\u4e8e\u884c\u4e3a\u503e\u5411\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u80fd\u529b\u9000\u5316\u6216\u77e5\u8bc6\u6c61\u67d3\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7a33\u5065\u5bf9\u9f50\u5fc5\u987b\u89e3\u51b3\u884c\u4e3a\u503e\u5411\u95ee\u9898\u800c\u975e\u5b64\u7acb\u9519\u8bef\u6216\u63d0\u793a\u7ea7\u9632\u5fa1"}}

Developing safeguards for LLMs inspired by this mechanism might be particularly helpful for their application in high-stakes tasks such as automating compliance with data privacy laws. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Epistemic Fallback (DEF), a dynamic safety protocol for improving an LLM's inference-time defenses against deceptive attacks that make use of maliciously perturbed policy texts. Through various levels of one-sentence textual cues, DEF nudges LLMs to flag inconsistencies, refuse compliance, and fallback to their parametric knowledge upon encountering perturbed policy texts. Using globally recognized legal policies such as HIPAA and GDPR, our empirical evaluations report that DEF effectively improves the capability of frontier LLMs to detect and refuse perturbed versions of policies, with DeepSeek-R1 achieving a 100% detection rate in one setting.

Existing iterative refinement methods in statement autoformalization typicall improve isolated aspects of formalization, such as syntactic correctness, but struggle to jointly optimizing multiple quality dimensions, which is critical for full-theorem autoformalization. We introduce a reference-free iterative monotonic process for full-theorem autoformalization that leverages complementary feedback from theorem provers and LLM-based judges, without access to ground-truth proofs or existing formalizations at inference time. Our approach optimizes a masked composite objective over Formal Validity, Logical Preservation, Mathematical Consistency, and Formal Quality, guided by a responsiveness map that indicates how different LLMs acting as different roles preferentially improve each dimension. We further propose an acceptance policy that guarantees certified monotonic improvement, and provide conditions ensuring convergence and termination. Empirical experiments demonstrate the proposed process enables simultaneous improvement across multiple dimensions, achieving 93.44% formal validity and a 78.22% overall score on miniF2F, and 44.09% formal validity and a 29.79% overall score on ProofNet.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u5355\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u5b9a\u7406\u81ea\u52a8\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u5668\u548cLLM\u6cd5\u5b98\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u8bc1\u660e\u6216\u73b0\u6709\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bed\u53e5\u81ea\u52a8\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5b64\u7acb\u6539\u8fdb\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7684\u5355\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\uff08\u5982\u8bed\u6cd5\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u4e2a\u8d28\u91cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u5168\u5b9a\u7406\u81ea\u52a8\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u8fed\u4ee3\u5355\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u5668\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u6cd5\u5b98\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u6620\u5c04\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u89d2\u8272\u4f18\u5148\u6539\u8fdb\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5f62\u5f0f\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u903b\u8f91\u4fdd\u6301\u3001\u6570\u5b66\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5f62\u5f0f\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u590d\u5408\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8ba4\u8bc1\u5355\u8c03\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u63a5\u53d7\u7b56\u7565", "result": "\u5728miniF2F\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523093.44%\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c78.22%\u7684\u603b\u4f53\u5f97\u5206\uff0c\u5728ProofNet\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523044.09%\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c29.79%\u7684\u603b\u4f53\u5f97\u5206\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u6539\u8fdb\u591a\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u4e2a\u8d28\u91cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5168\u5b9a\u7406\u81ea\u52a8\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u7ec8\u6b62\u6027"}}

Recent latent reasoning methods attempt to mitigate this by compressing reasoning processes into latent space, but often suffer from severe performance degradation due to the lack of appropriate compression guidance. In this study, we propose Rendered CoT-Guided variational Latent Reasoning (ReGuLaR), a simple yet novel latent learning paradigm resolving this issue. Fundamentally, we formulate latent reasoning within the Variational Auto-Encoding (VAE) framework, sampling the current latent reasoning state from the posterior distribution conditioned on previous ones. Specifically, when learning this variational latent reasoning model, we render explicit reasoning chains as images, from which we extract dense visual-semantic representations to regularize the posterior distribution, thereby achieving efficient compression with minimal information loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReGuLaR significantly outperforms existing latent reasoning methods across both computational efficiency and reasoning effectiveness, and even surpasses CoT through multi-modal reasoning, providing a new and insightful solution to latent reasoning.

However, their practical failures often stem from the lack of mechanisms to monitor and regulate reasoning and retrieval states as tasks evolve under uncertainty. Insights from cognitive neuroscience suggest that human metacognition is hierarchically organized, integrating fast anomaly detection with selectively triggered, experience-driven reflection. In this work, we propose Deep Search with Meta-Cognitive Monitoring (DS-MCM), a deep search framework augmented with an explicit hierarchical metacognitive monitoring mechanism. DS-MCM integrates a Fast Consistency Monitor, which performs lightweight checks on the alignment between external evidence and internal reasoning confidence, and a Slow Experience-Driven Monitor, which is selectively activated to guide corrective intervention based on experience memory from historical agent trajectories. By embedding monitoring directly into the reasoning-retrieval loop, DS-MCM determines both when intervention is warranted and how corrective actions should be informed by prior experience. Experiments across multiple deep search benchmarks and backbone models demonstrate that DS-MCM consistently improves performance and robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDS-MCM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u76d1\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u589e\u5f3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u641c\u7d22\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5feb\u901f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u6162\u901f\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9a71\u52a8\u76d1\u63a7\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u641c\u7d22\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u957f\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5e38\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\u4e0e\u8c03\u8282\u673a\u5236\u800c\u5931\u8d25\u3002\u53d7\u8ba4\u77e5\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u662f\u5206\u5c42\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u5feb\u901f\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6709\u9009\u62e9\u89e6\u53d1\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9a71\u52a8\u53cd\u601d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDS-MCM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1) \u5feb\u901f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\uff1a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u68c0\u67e5\u5916\u90e8\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0e\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b2) \u6162\u901f\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9a71\u52a8\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\uff1a\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u4ee3\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6307\u5bfc\u7ea0\u6b63\u5e72\u9884\u3002\u5c06\u76d1\u63a7\u76f4\u63a5\u5d4c\u5165\u63a8\u7406-\u68c0\u7d22\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u4f55\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u5e72\u9884\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u57fa\u4e8e\u5148\u9a8c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u91c7\u53d6\u7ea0\u6b63\u884c\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6df1\u5ea6\u641c\u7d22\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDS-MCM\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DS-MCM\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5206\u5c42\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u76d1\u63a7\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u641c\u7d22\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u4e2d\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u8c03\u8282\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

A Practical Study of the Tokenization Boundary Problem", "comment": null, "summary": "Language models (LMs) are trained over sequences of tokens, whereas users interact with LMs via text. This mismatch gives rise to the partial token problem, which occurs when a user ends their prompt in the middle of the expected next-token, leading to distorted next-token predictions. Although this issue has been studied using arbitrary character prefixes, its prevalence and severity in realistic prompts respecting word boundaries remains underexplored. In this work, we identify three domains where token and \"word\" boundaries often do not line up: languages that do not use whitespace, highly compounding languages, and code. In Chinese, for example, up to 25% of word boundaries do not line up with token boundaries, making even natural, word-complete prompts susceptible to this problem. We systematically construct semantically natural prompts ending with a partial tokens; in experiments, we find that they comprise a serious failure mode: frontier LMs consistently place three orders of magnitude less probability on the correct continuation compared to when the prompt is \"backed-off\" to be token-aligned. This degradation does not diminish with scale and often worsens for larger models. Finally, we evaluate inference-time mitigations to the partial token problem and validate the effectiveness of recent exact solutions. Overall, we demonstrate the scale and severity of probability distortion caused by tokenization in realistic use cases, and provide practical recommentions for model inference providers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5355\u8bcd\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u6bd4\u60f3\u8c61\u4e2d\u66f4\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b63\u786e\u7eed\u5199\u6982\u7387\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e14\u95ee\u9898\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u5927\u800c\u6076\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u8bcd\u5e8f\u5217\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u7528\u6237\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u5bfc\u81f4\"\u90e8\u5206\u5206\u8bcd\u95ee\u9898\"\uff1a\u5f53\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u9884\u671f\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u8bcd\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u7ed3\u675f\u65f6\uff0c\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u8bcd\u9884\u6d4b\u5931\u771f\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5173\u6ce8\u4efb\u610f\u5b57\u7b26\u524d\u7f00\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5c0a\u91cd\u5355\u8bcd\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\u548c\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u8bc6\u522b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5206\u8bcd\u4e0e\"\u5355\u8bcd\"\u8fb9\u754c\u5e38\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff1a\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u7a7a\u683c\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982\u4e2d\u6587\uff09\u3001\u9ad8\u5ea6\u590d\u5408\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u6784\u5efa\u8bed\u4e49\u81ea\u7136\u4f46\u4ee5\u90e8\u5206\u5206\u8bcd\u7ed3\u5c3e\u7684\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u6d4b\u91cf\u6b63\u786e\u7eed\u5199\u6982\u7387\u7684\u4e0b\u964d\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7f13\u89e3\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6700\u8fd1\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e2d\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u9ad8\u8fbe25%\u7684\u5355\u8bcd\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0e\u5206\u8bcd\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u3001\u5355\u8bcd\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4e5f\u6613\u53d7\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u524d\u6cbf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u5206\u8bcd\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\uff0c\u6b63\u786e\u7eed\u5199\u6982\u7387\u6bd4\u5206\u8bcd\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u793a\u4f4e\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u4e0d\u968f\u89c4\u6a21\u51cf\u5c0f\uff0c\u4e14\u5e38\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u589e\u5927\u800c\u6076\u5316\u3002\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7f13\u89e3\u63aa\u65bd\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u8bcd\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u7528\u4f8b\u4e2d\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5931\u771f\u95ee\u9898\u89c4\u6a21\u5927\u4e14\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u91c7\u53d6\u5b9e\u9645\u63aa\u65bd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6700\u8fd1\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

This transition, however, introduces a distinct class of vulnerabilities that remain largely uncharacterized. We examine the security implications of this modality shift by designing a text-to-audio jailbreak that embeds disallowed directives within a narrative-style audio stream. The attack leverages an advanced instruction-following text-to-speech (TTS) model to exploit structural and acoustic properties, thereby circumventing safety mechanisms primarily calibrated for text. When delivered through synthetic speech, the narrative format elicits restricted outputs from state-of-the-art models, including Gemini 2.0 Flash, achieving a 98.26% success rate that substantially exceeds text-only baselines.

While this formulation enables the use of advanced planning algorithms, these methods typically assume access to supervised reward signals, which are often unavailable in practical scenarios. In this work, we propose UPA, an Unsupervised Prompt Agent that realizes structured search and selection without relying on supervised feedback. Specifically, during search, UPA iteratively constructs an evolving tree structure to navigate the prompt space, guided by fine-grained and order-invariant pairwise comparisons from Large Language Models (LLMs). Crucially, as these local comparisons do not inherently yield a consistent global scale, we decouple systematic prompt exploration from final selection, introducing a two-stage framework grounded in the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model. This framework first performs path-wise Bayesian aggregation of local comparisons to filter candidates under uncertainty, followed by global tournament-style comparisons to infer latent prompt quality and identify the optimal prompt. Experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate that UPA consistently outperforms existing prompt optimization methods, showing that agent-style optimization remains highly effective even in fully unsupervised settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "UPA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u63d0\u793a\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u76d1\u7763\u53cd\u9988\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u53ef\u5f97\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "UPA\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u6f14\u5316\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u63d0\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u987a\u5e8f\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f83\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8eBradley-Terry-Luce\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5148\u8fdb\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u7ea7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u805a\u5408\u7b5b\u9009\u5019\u9009\uff0c\u518d\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u5c40\u9526\u6807\u8d5b\u5f0f\u6bd4\u8f83\u63a8\u65ad\u6f5c\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cUPA\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ee3\u7406\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u4ecd\u7136\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "UPA\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u76d1\u7763\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}
