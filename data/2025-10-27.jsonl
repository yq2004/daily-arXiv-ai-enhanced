However, SFT,\nbeing an off-policy approach similar to behavior cloning, often struggles with\noverfitting and poor out-of-domain generalization, especially in limited-data\nscenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Rewarding PPO, a novel\nfine-tuning method that leverages on-policy techniques to enhance\ngeneralization performance. Our approach combines the strengths of SFT and\nproximal policy optimization (PPO) to achieve more effective alignment from\ndemonstration data.

This function serves\nas an implicit reward signal, using the pretrained policy as a baseline and the\nSFT policy as a target. By doing so, it enables on-policy fine-tuning without\nrelying on human preference annotations. The integration of this self-rewarding\nmechanism with PPO addresses key limitations of SFT, improving generalization,\ndata efficiency, and robustness.

Trained from scratch on 312 GB\nof Turkish text (mC4, OSCAR23, Wikipedia), SindBERT is released in both base\nand large configurations, representing the first large-scale encoder-only\nlanguage model available for Turkish. We evaluate SindBERT on part-of-speech\ntagging, named entity recognition, offensive language detection, and the\nTurBLiMP linguistic acceptability benchmark. Our results show that SindBERT\nperforms competitively with existing Turkish and multilingual models, with the\nlarge variant achieving the best scores in two of four tasks but showing no\nconsistent scaling advantage overall. This flat scaling trend, also observed\nfor XLM-R and EuroBERT, suggests that current Turkish benchmarks may already be\nsaturated. At the same time, comparisons with smaller but more curated models\nsuch as BERTurk highlight that corpus quality and diversity can outweigh sheer\ndata volume. Taken together, SindBERT contributes both as an openly released\nresource for Turkish NLP and as an empirical case study on the limits of\nscaling and the central role of corpus composition in morphologically rich\nlanguages. The SindBERT models are released under the MIT license and made\navailable in both fairseq and Huggingface formats."}
