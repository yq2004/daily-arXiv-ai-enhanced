It features 1 trillion total parameters and\nactivates approximately 50 billion per token. Training such models at a\ntrillion-parameter scale introduces unprecedented challenges, including\ntrain-inference misalignment, inefficiencies in rollout processing, and\nbottlenecks in the RL system. To address these, we pioneer three interconnected\ninnovations: (1) IcePop stabilizes RL training via token-level discrepancy\nmasking and clipping, resolving instability from training-inference mismatches;\n(2) C3PO++ improves resource utilization for long rollouts under a token budget\nby dynamically partitioning them, thereby obtaining high time efficiency; and\n(3) ASystem, a high-performance RL framework designed to overcome the systemic\nbottlenecks that impede trillion-parameter model training. Ring-1T delivers\nbreakthrough results across critical benchmarks: 93.4 on AIME-2025, 86.72 on\nHMMT-2025, 2088 on CodeForces, and 55.94 on ARC-AGI-v1. Notably, it attains a\nsilver medal-level result on the IMO-2025, underscoring its exceptional\nreasoning capabilities. By releasing the complete 1T parameter MoE model to the\ncommunity, we provide the research community with direct access to cutting-edge\nreasoning capabilities. This contribution marks a significant milestone in\ndemocratizing large-scale reasoning intelligence and establishes a new baseline\nfor open-source model performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Memory systems enable LLMs to move beyond stateless\ninteractions by introducing persistent information storage, retrieval, and\nutilization mechanisms. However, existing memory systems often introduce\nsubstantial time and computational overhead. To this end, we introduce a new\nmemory system called LightMem, which strikes a balance between the performance\nand efficiency of memory systems. Inspired by the Atkinson-Shiffrin model of\nhuman memory, LightMem organizes memory into three complementary stages. First,\ncognition-inspired sensory memory rapidly filters irrelevant information\nthrough lightweight compression and groups information according to their\ntopics. Next, topic-aware short-term memory consolidates these topic-based\ngroups, organizing and summarizing content for more structured access. Finally,\nlong-term memory with sleep-time update employs an offline procedure that\ndecouples consolidation from online inference. Experiments on LongMemEval with\nGPT and Qwen backbones show that LightMem outperforms strong baselines in\naccuracy (up to 10.9% gains) while reducing token usage by up to 117x, API\ncalls by up to 159x, and runtime by over 12x.

In this paper, we trace the intermediate representations\nof several open-weight models during inference and reveal a structured and\nnuanced use of depth. Specifically, we propose a \"Guess-then-Refine\" framework\nthat explains how LLMs internally structure their computations to make\npredictions. We first show that the top-ranked predictions in early LLM layers\nare composed primarily of high-frequency tokens, which act as statistical\nguesses proposed by the model early on due to the lack of appropriate\ncontextual information. As contextual information develops deeper into the\nmodel, these initial guesses get refined into contextually appropriate tokens.\nEven high-frequency token predictions from early layers get refined >70% of the\ntime, indicating that correct token prediction is not \"one-and-done\". We then\ngo beyond frequency-based prediction to examine the dynamic usage of layer\ndepth across three case studies. (i) Part-of-speech analysis shows that\nfunction words are, on average, the earliest to be predicted correctly. (ii)\nFact recall task analysis shows that, in a multi-token answer, the first token\nrequires more computational depth than the rest. (iii) Multiple-choice task\nanalysis shows that the model identifies the format of the response within the\nfirst half of the layers, but finalizes its response only toward the end.\nTogether, our results provide a detailed view of depth usage in LLMs, shedding\nlight on the layer-by-layer computations that underlie successful predictions\nand providing insights for future works to improve computational efficiency in\ntransformer-based models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
