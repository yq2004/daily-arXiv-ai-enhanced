However, many existing taxonomies suffer from limited coverage and outdated or ambiguous nodes, reducing their effectiveness in knowledge retrieval. To address this, we present Taxoria, a novel taxonomy enrichment pipeline that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance a given taxonomy. Unlike approaches that extract internal LLM taxonomies, Taxoria uses an existing taxonomy as a seed and prompts an LLM to propose candidate nodes for enrichment. These candidates are then validated to mitigate hallucinations and ensure semantic relevance before integration. The final output includes an enriched taxonomy with provenance tracking and visualization of the final merged taxonomy for analysis."}

However, static documentation such as printed manuals or PDFs is often outdated, fragmented, and difficult to search, creating risks of workflow errors and diagnostic delays. This study proposes and evaluates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistant tailored to AP laboratories, designed to provide technicians with context-grounded answers to protocol-related queries. We curated a novel corpus of 99 AP protocols from a Portuguese healthcare institution and constructed 323 question-answer pairs for systematic evaluation. Ten experiments were conducted, varying chunking strategies, retrieval methods, and embedding models. Performance was assessed using the RAGAS framework (faithfulness, answer relevance, context recall) alongside top-k retrieval metrics. Results show that recursive chunking and hybrid retrieval delivered the strongest baseline performance. Incorporating a biomedical-specific embedding model (MedEmbed) further improved answer relevance (0.74), faithfulness (0.70), and context recall (0.77), showing the importance of domain-specialised embeddings. Top-k analysis revealed that retrieving a single top-ranked chunk (k=1) maximized efficiency and accuracy, reflecting the modular structure of AP protocols. These findings highlight critical design considerations for deploying RAG systems in healthcare and demonstrate their potential to transform static documentation into dynamic, reliable knowledge assistants, thus improving laboratory workflow efficiency and supporting patient safety."}

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a key innovation, enhancing factual accuracy and contextual grounding by integrating external knowledge sources with generative models. Although RAG demonstrates strong performance on unstructured text, its application to structured knowledge graphs presents challenges: scaling retrieval across connected graphs and preserving contextual relationships during response generation. Cross-encoders refine retrieval precision, yet their integration with structured data remains underexplored. Addressing these challenges is crucial for developing domain-specific assistants that operate in production environments. This study presents the design and comparative evaluation of multiple Retriever-Reranker pipelines for knowledge graph natural language queries in e-Commerce contexts. Using the STaRK Semi-structured Knowledge Base (SKB), a production-scale e-Commerce dataset, we evaluate multiple RAG pipeline configurations optimized for language queries. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements over published benchmarks, achieving 20.4% higher Hit@1 and 14.5% higher Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). These findings establish a practical framework for integrating domain-specific SKBs into generative systems. Our contributions provide actionable insights for the deployment of production-ready RAG systems, with implications that extend beyond e-Commerce to other domains that require information retrieval from structured knowledge bases."}

Testing Thick Citation Context Analysis with GPT-5 and Fragile Prompts", "comment": "26 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables (plus 17 pages supplement including 1 figure)", "summary": "This paper tests whether large language models (LLMs) can support interpretative citation context analysis (CCA) by scaling in thick, text-grounded readings of a single hard case rather than scaling up typological labels. It foregrounds prompt-sensitivity analysis as a methodological issue by varying prompt scaffolding and framing in a balanced 2x3 design. Using footnote 6 in Chubin and Moitra (1975) and Gilbert's (1977) reconstruction as a probe, I implement a two-stage GPT-5 pipeline: a citation-text-only surface classification and expectation pass, followed by cross-document interpretative reconstruction using the citing and cited full texts. Across 90 reconstructions, the model produces 450 distinct hypotheses. Close reading and inductive coding identify 21 recurring interpretative moves, and linear probability models estimate how prompt choices shift their frequencies and lexical repertoire. GPT-5's surface pass is highly stable, consistently classifying the citation as \"supplementary\". In reconstruction, the model generates a structured space of plausible alternatives, but scaffolding and examples redistribute attention and vocabulary, sometimes toward strained readings. Relative to Gilbert, GPT-5 detects the same textual hinges yet more often resolves them as lineage and positioning than as admonishment. The study outlines opportunities and risks of using LLMs as guided co-analysts for inspectable, contestable interpretative CCA, and it shows that prompt scaffolding and framing systematically tilt which plausible readings and vocabularies the model foregrounds."}

Recommending \"Unexpected yet Rational\" Quotations via Novelty", "comment": "36 pages, 16 figures and 13 tables", "summary": "Quotation recommendation aims to enrich writing by suggesting quotes that complement a given context, yet existing systems mostly optimize surface-level topical relevance and ignore the deeper semantic and aesthetic properties that make quotations memorable. We start from two empirical observations. First, a systematic user study shows that people consistently prefer quotations that are ``unexpected yet rational'' in context, identifying novelty as a key desideratum. Second, we find that strong existing models struggle to fully understand the deep meanings of quotations. Inspired by defamiliarization theory, we therefore formalize quote recommendation as choosing contextually novel but semantically coherent quotations. We operationalize this objective with NovelQR, a novelty-driven quotation recommendation framework. A generative label agent first interprets each quotation and its surrounding context into multi-dimensional deep-meaning labels, enabling label-enhanced retrieval. A token-level novelty estimator then reranks candidates while mitigating auto-regressive continuation bias. Experiments on bilingual datasets spanning diverse real-world domains show that our system recommends quotations that human judges rate as more appropriate, more novel, and more engaging than other baselines, while matching or surpassing existing methods in novelty estimation."}

While often humorous, memes can also be exploited to spread offensive, harmful, and inflammatory content targeting individuals and groups. Detecting this type of content is excep- tionally challenging due to its satirical, subtle, and culturally specific nature. This problem is magnified for low-resource lan- guages like Bengali, as existing research predominantly focuses on high-resource languages. To address this critical research gap, we introduce Bn-HIB (Bangla Hate Inflammatory Benign), a novel dataset containing 3,247 manually annotated Bengali memes categorized as Benign, Hate, or Inflammatory. Significantly, Bn- HIB is the first dataset to distinguish inflammatory content from direct hate speech in Bengali memes. Furthermore, we propose the MCFM (Multi-Modal Co-Attention Fusion Model), a simple yet effective architecture that mutually analyzes both the visual and textual elements of a meme. MCFM employs a co-attention mechanism to identify and fuse the most critical features from each modality, leading to a more accurate classification. Our experiments show that MCFM significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art models on the Bn-HIB dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in this nuanced task.Warning: This work contains material that may be disturbing to some audience members.

We revisit Function Vectors (FVs), compact representations of in-context learning (ICL) tasks that causally drive task performance. Across multiple LLMs, we show that FVs are not fully invariant: FVs are nearly orthogonal when extracted from different input formats (e.g., open-ended vs. multiple-choice), even if both target the same concept. We identify Concept Vectors (CVs), which carry more stable concept representations. Like FVs, CVs are composed of attention head outputs; however, unlike FVs, the constituent heads are selected using Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) based on whether they encode concepts consistently across input formats. While these heads emerge in similar layers to FV-related heads, the two sets are largely distinct, suggesting different underlying mechanisms. Steering experiments reveal that FVs excel in-distribution, when extraction and application formats match (e.g., both open-ended in English), while CVs generalize better out-of-distribution across both question types (open-ended vs. multiple-choice) and languages. Our results show that LLMs do contain abstract concept representations, but these differ from those that drive ICL performance."}

When left unnoticed, it can have adverse consequences for social and mental health. Researchers have explored various types of cyberbullying, but most approaches use single-label classification, assuming that each comment contains only one type of abuse. In reality, a single comment may include overlapping forms such as threats, hate speech, and harassment. Therefore, multilabel detection is both realistic and essential. However, multilabel cyberbullying detection has received limited attention, especially in low-resource languages like Bangla, where robust pre-trained models are scarce. Developing a generalized model with moderate accuracy remains challenging. Transformers offer strong contextual understanding but may miss sequential dependencies, while LSTM models capture temporal flow but lack semantic depth. To address these limitations, we propose a fusion architecture that combines BanglaBERT-Large with a two-layer stacked LSTM. We analyze their behavior to jointly model context and sequence. The model is fine-tuned and evaluated on a publicly available multilabel Bangla cyberbullying dataset covering cyberbully, sexual harassment, threat, and spam. We apply different sampling strategies to address class imbalance. Evaluation uses multiple metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Hamming loss, Cohens kappa, and AUC-ROC.

However, current pipelines are limited by static chunking and flat retrieval: documents are split into short, predetermined, fixed-size chunks, embeddings are retrieved uniformly, and generation relies on whatever chunks are returned. This design brings challenges, as retrieval quality is highly sensitive to chunk size, often introduces noise from irrelevant or misleading chunks, and scales poorly to large corpora. We present SmartChunk retrieval, a query-adaptive framework for efficient and robust long-document question answering (QA). SmartChunk uses (i) a planner that predicts the optimal chunk abstraction level for each query, and (ii) a lightweight compression module that produces high-level chunk embeddings without repeated summarization. By adapting retrieval granularity on the fly, SmartChunk balances accuracy with efficiency and avoids the drawbacks of fixed strategies. Notably, our planner can reason about chunk abstractions through a novel reinforcement learning scheme, STITCH, which boosts accuracy and generalization. To reflect real-world applications, where users face diverse document types and query styles, we evaluate SmartChunk on five QA benchmarks plus one out-of-domain dataset. Across these evaluations, SmartChunk outperforms state-of-the-art RAG baselines, while reducing cost. Further analysis demonstrates strong scalability with larger corpora and consistent gains on out-of-domain datasets, highlighting its effectiveness as a general framework for adaptive retrieval."}

To overcome these critical limitations, we propose Self-Evolved Generative Bidding (SEGB), a framework that plans proactively and refines itself entirely offline. SEGB first synthesizes plausible short-horizon future states to guide each bid, providing the agent with crucial, dynamic foresight. Crucially, it then performs value-guided policy refinement to iteratively discover superior strategies without any external intervention. This self-contained approach uniquely enables robust policy improvement from static data alone. Experiments on the AuctionNet benchmark and a large-scale A/B test validate our approach, demonstrating that SEGB significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

This persona originally arose rather by accident on Microsoft's Bing Search platform; however, the texts it created spread into the training data of subsequent models, as did other secondary information that spread memetically around this persona. Newer models are therefore able to simulate it.

At the coarse stage, a top-k filtering strategy builds a small yet high-quality candidate pool for each query, enabling MLLMs to focus on semantically relevant candidates. Subsequently, the retrieval score is predicted by feeding both the query and candidate into MLLMs at the fine stage. Importantly, we propose a visual enhancement module during reasoning to help MLLMs re-pick forgotten visuals, improving retrieval. Extensive experiments on MMIR benchmarks show that RetLLM outperforms fine-tuned models. Ablation studies further verify each component. Our work demonstrates that MLLMs can achieve strong MMIR performance without any training, highlighting their inherent multimodal reasoning ability in a simple, scalable framework.

However, existing methods primarily optimize the negative sampling process while neglecting the exploration of positive samples. Some denoising recommendation methods can be applied to denoise positive samples within negative sampling strategies, but they ignore temporal information. Existing work integrates sequential information during model aggregation but neglects time interval information, hindering accurate capture of users' current preferences. To address this problem, from a data perspective, we propose a novel temporal filtration-enhanced approach to construct a high-quality positive sample set. First, we design a time decay model based on interaction time intervals, transforming the original graph into a weighted user-item bipartite graph. Then, based on predefined filtering operations, the weighted user-item bipartite graph is layered. Finally, we design a layer-enhancement strategy to construct a high-quality positive sample set for the layered subgraphs. We provide theoretical insights into why TFPS can improve Recall@k and NDCG@k, and extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Additionally, TFPS can be integrated with various implicit CF recommenders or negative sampling methods to enhance its performance."}

Traditional ASR models often encounter difficulties in this context, as they tend to conflate essential linguistic content with dialect-specific variations across both phonological and lexical dimensions. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework grounded in the Recurrent Neural Network Transducers (RNN-T). Central to our approach is the introduction of dialect-aware modeling strategies designed to disentangle dialectal \"style\" from linguistic \"content\", which enhances the model's capacity to learn robust and generalized representations. Additionally, the framework employs parameter-efficient prediction networks to concurrently model ASR (Hanzi and Pinyin). We demonstrate that these tasks create a powerful synergy, wherein the cross-script objective serves as a mutual regularizer to improve the primary ASR tasks. Experiments conducted on the HAT corpus reveal that our model achieves 57.00% and 40.41% relative error rate reduction on Hanzi and Pinyin ASR, respectively.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel dense retrieval approach, termed \\textit{dynamic dense retrieval} (DDR).

Despite their success, these methods predominantly rely on generative scoring or output logits, which face bottlenecks in inference latency and result consistency. In-Context Re-ranking (ICR) has recently been proposed as an $O(1)$ alternative method. ICR extracts internal attention signals directly, avoiding the overhead of text generation. However, existing ICR methods simply aggregate signals across all layers; layer-wise contributions and their consistency across architectures have been left unexplored. Furthermore, no unified study has compared internal attention with traditional generative and likelihood-based mechanisms across diverse ranking frameworks under consistent conditions.\n  In this paper, we conduct an orthogonal evaluation of generation, likelihood, and internal attention mechanisms across multiple ranking frameworks. We further identify a universal \"bell-curve\" distribution of relevance signals across transformer layers, which motivates the proposed Selective-ICR strategy that reduces inference latency by 30%-50% without compromising effectiveness. Finally, evaluation on the reasoning-intensive BRIGHT benchmark shows that precisely capturing high-quality in-context attention signals fundamentally reduces the need for model scaling and reinforcement learning: a zero-shot 8B model matches the performance of 14B reinforcement-learned re-rankers, while even a 0.6B model outperforms state-of-the-art generation-based approaches. These findings redefine the efficiency-effectiveness frontier for LLM-based re-ranking and highlight the latent potential of internal signals for complex reasoning ranking tasks.

We propose Search-P1, a framework that introduces path-centric reward shaping for agentic RAG training, comprising two key components: (1) Path-Centric Reward, which evaluates the structural quality of reasoning trajectories through order-agnostic step coverage and soft scoring that extracts learning signals even from failed samples, and (2) Dual-Track Path Scoring with offline-generated reference planners that assesses paths from both self-consistency and reference-alignment perspectives.

Specifically, TS-Rec comprises two key components: (1) Semantic-Aware embedding Initialization (SA-Init), which initializes SID token embeddings by applying mean pooling to the pretrained embeddings of keywords extracted by a teacher model; and (2) Token-level Semantic Alignment (TS-Align), which aligns individual tokens within the SID sequence with the shared semantics of the corresponding item clusters.

However, industrial recommender systems often benefit from restricting the output space to a constrained subset of items based on business logic (e.g. enforcing content freshness or product category), which standard autoregressive decoding cannot natively support. Moreover, existing constrained decoding methods that make use of prefix trees (Tries) incur severe latency penalties on hardware accelerators (TPUs/GPUs). In this work, we introduce STATIC (Sparse Transition Matrix-Accelerated Trie Index for Constrained Decoding), an efficient and scalable constrained decoding technique designed specifically for high-throughput LLM-based generative retrieval on TPUs/GPUs. By flattening the prefix tree into a static Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) matrix, we transform irregular tree traversals into fully vectorized sparse matrix operations, unlocking massive efficiency gains on hardware accelerators. We deploy STATIC on a large-scale industrial video recommendation platform serving billions of users. STATIC produces significant product metric impact with minimal latency overhead (0.033 ms per step and 0.25% of inference time), achieving a 948x speedup over a CPU trie implementation and a 47-1033x speedup over a hardware-accelerated binary-search baseline. Furthermore, the runtime overhead of STATIC remains extremely low across a wide range of practical configurations. To the best of our knowledge, STATIC enables the first production-scale deployment of strictly constrained generative retrieval.

However, unsupervised entity alignment in multimodal settings remains underexplored, mainly because the incorporation of multimodal information often results in imbalanced coverage of pseudo-seeds within the knowledge graph. To overcome this, we propose PSQE (Pseudo-Seed Quality Enhancement) to improve the precision and graph coverage balance of pseudo seeds via multimodal information and clustering-resampling. Theoretical analysis reveals the impact of pseudo seeds on existing contrastive learning-based MMEA models. In particular, pseudo seeds can influence the attraction and the repulsion terms in contrastive learning at once, whereas imbalanced graph coverage causes models to prioritize high-density regions, thereby weakening their learning capability for entities in sparse regions.

However, it remains challenging due to the highly complex and long-tailed nature of the data distributions. Existing generative approaches rely on rigid parametric distribution assumptions, which fundamentally limits their performance when such assumptions misalign with real-world data. Overly simplified forms cannot adequately model real-world complexities, while more intricate assumptions often suffer from poor scalability and generalization.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a residual quantization (RQ)-based sequence learning framework that represents target continuous values as a sum of ordered quantization codes, predicted recursively from coarse to fine granularity with diminishing quantization errors. We introduce a representation learning objective that aligns RQ code embedding space with the ordinal structure of target values, allowing the model to capture continuous representations for quantization codes and further improving prediction accuracy. We perform extensive evaluations on public benchmarks for lifetime value (LTV) and watch-time prediction, alongside a large-scale online experiment for GMV prediction on an industrial short-video recommendation platform. The results consistently show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, while demonstrating strong generalization across diverse continuous value prediction tasks in recommendation systems."}

To address this, we propose KGT, a novel framework that uses dedicated entity tokens to enable efficient, full-space prediction. Specifically, we first introduce specialized tokenization to construct feature representations at the level of dedicated entity tokens. We then fuse pre-trained structural and textual features into these unified embeddings via a relation-guided gating mechanism, avoiding training from scratch.

These documents are widely observed across domains and account for a large portion of real-world data. However, existing methods struggle to support natural language question answering over these documents due to three main technical challenges: (1) The elements extracted by techniques like OCR are often fragmented and stripped of their original semantic context, making them inadequate for analysis. (2) Existing approaches lack effective representations to capture hierarchical structures within documents (e.g., associating tables with nested chapter titles) and to preserve layout-specific distinctions (e.g., differentiating sidebars from main content). (3) Answering questions often requires retrieving and aligning relevant information scattered across multiple regions or pages, such as linking a descriptive paragraph to table cells located elsewhere in the document.\n  To address these issues, we propose MoDora, an LLM-powered system for semi-structured document analysis. First, we adopt a local-alignment aggregation strategy to convert OCR-parsed elements into layout-aware components, and conduct type-specific information extraction for components with hierarchical titles or non-text elements. Second, we design the Component-Correlation Tree (CCTree) to hierarchically organize components, explicitly modeling inter-component relations and layout distinctions through a bottom-up cascade summarization process. Finally, we propose a question-type-aware retrieval strategy that supports (1) layout-based grid partitioning for location-based retrieval and (2) LLM-guided pruning for semantic-based retrieval.

Our experiments show that existing annotator-specific models perform poorly in IDRR unless ambiguity is reduced, whereas models trained on label distributions yield more stable predictions. Further analysis indicates that frequent cognitively demanding cases drive inconsistency in human interpretation, posing challenges for perspectivist modeling in IDRR."}

However, these approaches typically lead to a non-negligible drop in accuracy. Notably, the angle of lossless acceleration by optimizing feature fusion matrix multiplication, particularly through structural reparameterization, remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose MaRI, a novel Matrix Re-parameterized Inference framework, which serves as a complementary approach to existing techniques while accelerating ranking model inference without any accuracy loss. MaRI is motivated by the observation that user-side computation is redundant in feature fusion matrix multiplication, and we therefore adopt the philosophy of structural reparameterization to alleviate such redundancy."}

However, these methods still ignore the user's latent preference that underlying decision-making, leading to suboptimal solutions.

This framework enables a rigorous evaluation of current LLM capabilities with respect to the simulation of social media user behavior. We evaluated open-weight 8B models (Llama3.1, Qwen3, Ministral) in English, German, and Luxembourgish language scenarios. By systematically comparing prompting strategies (explicit vs. implicit) and the impact of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), we identify a critical form vs. content decoupling in low-resource settings: while SFT aligns the surface structure of the text output (length and syntax), it degrades semantic grounding. Furthermore, we demonstrate that explicit conditioning (generated biographies) becomes redundant under fine-tuning, as models successfully perform latent inference directly from behavioral histories.

We first address this by systematically evaluating LLM configurations, finding that a specialized, fine-tuned model significantly outperforms a much larger pre-trained one in providing highly relevant labels. Using this optimal model as a force multiplier, we generate millions of textual relevance labels to overcome the data scarcity. We show that augmenting our production ranker with these textual relevance labels leads to a significant outward shift of the Pareto frontier: offline NDCG improves for behavioral relevance while simultaneously increasing for textual relevance. These offline gains were validated by a worldwide A/B test on the App Store ranker, which demonstrated a statistically significant +0.24% increase in conversion rate, with the most substantial performance gains occurring in tail queries, where the new textual relevance labels provide a robust signal in the absence of reliable behavioral relevance labels."}

AuditBench models are highly diverse--some are subtle, while others are overt, and we use varying training techniques both for implanting behaviors and training models not to confess. To demonstrate AuditBench's utility, we develop an investigator agent that autonomously employs a configurable set of auditing tools. By measuring investigator agent success using different tools, we can evaluate their efficacy. Notably, we observe a tool-to-agent gap, where tools that perform well in standalone non-agentic evaluations fail to translate into improved performance when used with our investigator agent. We find that our most effective tools involve scaffolded calls to auxiliary models that generate diverse prompts for the target. White-box interpretability tools can be helpful, but the agent performs best with black-box tools. We also find that audit success varies greatly across training techniques: models trained on synthetic documents are easier to audit than models trained on demonstrations, with better adversarial training further increasing auditing difficulty. We release our models, agent, and evaluation framework to support future quantitative, iterative science on alignment auditing."}

We propose Search-P1, a framework that introduces path-centric reward shaping for agentic RAG training, comprising two key components: (1) Path-Centric Reward, which evaluates the structural quality of reasoning trajectories through order-agnostic step coverage and soft scoring that extracts learning signals even from failed samples, and (2) Dual-Track Path Scoring with offline-generated reference planners that assesses paths from both self-consistency and reference-alignment perspectives.

Extensive experiments across various models and datasets demonstrate that our approach can utilize training data more effectively than vanilla RL and achieve better performance under the same training data.

While recognized as a promising paradigm for visual reasoning, the underlying mechanisms driving its effectiveness remain unclear.

We model the process as a causal chain: the input as the treatment, the latent tokens as the mediator, and the final answer as the outcome. Our findings uncover two critical disconnections: (a) Input-Latent Disconnect: dramatic perturbations on the input result in negligible changes to the latent tokens, suggesting that latent tokens do not effectively attend to the input sequence. (b) Latent-Answer Disconnect: perturbations on the latent tokens yield minimal impact on the final answer, indicating the limited causal effect latent tokens imposing on the outcome. Furthermore, extensive probing analysis reveals that latent tokens encode limited visual information and exhibit high similarity. Consequently, we challenge the necessity of latent reasoning and propose a straightforward alternative named CapImagine, which teaches the model to explicitly imagine using text. Experiments on vision-centric benchmarks show that CapImagine significantly outperforms complex latent-space baselines, highlighting the superior potential of visual reasoning through explicit imagination."}

Yet existing benchmarks are small, manually curated - and therefore error-prone - and contain shallow questions that seldom demand more than two hops or invoke aggregations, grouping, or other advanced analytical operations expressible in natural-language queries. We present SPARTA, an end-to-end construction framework that automatically generates large-scale Table-Text QA benchmarks with lightweight human validation, requiring only one quarter of the annotation time of HybridQA. The framework first constructs a reference fact database by enriching each source table with grounding tables whose tuples are atomic facts automatically extracted from the accompanying unstructured passages, then synthesizes nested queries whose number of nested predicates matches the desired hop count. To ensure that every SQL statement is executable and that its verbalization yields a fluent, human-sounding question, we propose two novel techniques: provenance-based refinement, which rewrites any syntactically valid query that returns a non-empty result, and realistic-structure enforcement, which confines generation to post-order traversals of the query graph. The resulting pipeline produces thousands of high-fidelity question-answer pairs covering aggregations, grouping, and deep multi-hop reasoning across text and tables. On SPARTA, state-of-the-art models that reach over 70 F1 on HybridQA or over 50 F1 on OTT-QA drop by more than 30 F1 points, exposing fundamental weaknesses in current cross-modal reasoning.

This work focuses on the problem of contributive attribution: identifying the dominant knowledge source behind each output. We show that a probe, a simple linear classifier trained on model hidden representations, can reliably predict contributive attribution. For its training, we introduce AttriWiki, a self-supervised data pipeline that prompts models to recall withheld entities from memory or read them from context, generating labelled examples automatically. Probes trained on AttriWiki data reveal a strong attribution signal, achieving up to 0.96 Macro-F1 on Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and Qwen-7B, transferring to out-of-domain benchmarks (SQuAD, WebQuestions) with 0.94-0.99 Macro-F1 without retraining.

As models scale and update across generations, prompt behavior becomes sensitive to shifts in instruction-following policies, alignment regimes, and decoding strategies, a phenomenon we characterize as GPT-scale model drift. Under such conditions, surface-level formatting conventions and ad hoc refinement are insufficient to ensure stable, interpretable control. This paper reconceptualizes Natural Language Declarative Prompting (NLD-P) as a declarative governance method rather than a rigid field template. NLD-P is formalized as a modular control abstraction that separates provenance, constraint logic, task content, and post-generation evaluation, encoded directly in natural language without reliance on external orchestration code. We define minimal compliance criteria, analyze model-dependent schema receptivity, and position NLD-P as an accessible governance framework for non-developer practitioners operating within evolving LLM ecosystems.

However, due to the complex reasoning processes and substantial individual differences involved in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) clinical diagnosis and treatment, traditional RAG methods often exhibit poor performance in this domain. Objective: To address the limitations of conventional RAG approaches in TCM applications, this study aims to develop an improved RAG framework tailored to the characteristics of TCM reasoning. Methods: We developed TCM-DiffRAG, an innovative RAG framework that integrates knowledge graphs (KG) with chains of thought (CoT). TCM-DiffRAG was evaluated on three distinctive TCM test datasets. Results: The experimental results demonstrated that TCM-DiffRAG achieved significant performance improvements over native LLMs. For example, the qwen-plus model achieved scores of 0.927, 0.361, and 0.038, which were significantly enhanced to 0.952, 0.788, and 0.356 with TCM-DiffRAG. The improvements were even more pronounced for non-Chinese LLMs. Additionally, TCM-DiffRAG outperformed directly supervised fine-tuned (SFT) LLMs and other benchmark RAG methods. Conclusions: TCM-DiffRAG shows that integrating structured TCM knowledge graphs with Chain of Thought based reasoning substantially improves performance in individualized diagnostic tasks. The joint use of universal and personalized knowledge graphs enables effective alignment between general knowledge and clinical reasoning. These results highlight the potential of reasoning-aware RAG frameworks for advancing LLM applications in traditional Chinese medicine."}

Our method systematically expands the emotion lexicon through contextualized embeddings to identify emotionally charged terms not previously captured in the lexicon. Our expanded NRC lexicon (eNRC) improves over the baseline across all five datasets (up to +6.2 percentage points in F1 score), outperforms the original NRC on four datasets (up to +3.0), and surpasses the LLM-based approach on nearly all corpora. We provide all resources-including eNRC, the adapted corpora, and model architecture-to enable other researchers to build upon our work."}

We leverage the Question-Answer driven Semantic Role Labeling (QA-SRL) framework -- a natural-language formulation of predicate-argument relations -- as the foundation for extending semantic annotation to new languages. To this end, we introduce a cross-linguistic projection approach that reuses an English QA-SRL parser within a constrained translation and word-alignment pipeline to automatically generate question-answer annotations aligned with target-language predicates. Applied to Hebrew, Russian, and French -- spanning diverse language families -- the method yields high-quality training data and fine-tuned, language-specific parsers that outperform strong multilingual LLM baselines (GPT-4o, LLaMA-Maverick). By leveraging QA-SRL as a transferable natural-language interface for semantics, our approach enables efficient and broadly accessible predicate-argument parsing across languages."}

This stems from the ''combinatorial contradiction'' phenomenon, where parallel tokens form semantically inconsistent combinations. We address this by integrating continuous representations into the discrete decoding process, as they preserve rich inter-position dependency. We propose ReMix (Rejection Mixing), a framework that introduces a novel Continuous Mixing State as an intermediate between the initial masked state and the final decoded token state. This intermediate state allows a token's representation to be iteratively refined in a continuous space, resolving mutual conflicts with other tokens before collapsing into a final discrete sample. Furthermore, a rejection rule reverts uncertain representations from the continuous state back to the masked state for reprocessing, ensuring stability and preventing error propagation. ReMix thus mitigates combinatorial contradictions by enabling continuous-space refinement during discrete diffusion decoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReMix, as a training-free method, achieves a $2-8 \\times$ inference speedup without any quality degradation."}

We propose Stitching Noisy Diffusion Thoughts, a self-consistency framework that turns cheap diffusion-sampled reasoning into a reusable pool of step-level candidates. Given a problem, we (i) sample many diverse, low-cost reasoning trajectories using a masked diffusion language model, (ii) score every intermediate step with an off-the-shelf process reward model (PRM), and (iii) stitch these highest-quality steps across trajectories into a composite rationale. This rationale then conditions an autoregressive (AR) model (solver) to recompute only the final answer. This modular pipeline separates exploration (diffusion) from evaluation and solution synthesis, avoiding monolithic unified hybrids while preserving broad search. Across math reasoning benchmarks, we find that step-level recombination is most beneficial on harder problems, and ablations highlight the importance of the final AR solver in converting stitched but imperfect rationales into accurate answers. Using low-confidence diffusion sampling with parallel, independent rollouts, our training-free framework improves average accuracy by up to 23.8% across six math and coding tasks.

We investigate the OCR routing mechanism across three architecture families (Qwen3-VL, Phi-4, InternVL3.5) using causal interventions. By computing activation differences between original images and text-inpainted versions, we identify architecture-specific OCR bottlenecks whose dominant location depends on the vision-language integration strategy: DeepStack models (Qwen) show peak sensitivity at mid-depth (about 50%) for scene text, while single-stage projection models (Phi-4, InternVL) peak at early layers (6-25%), though the exact layer of maximum effect varies across datasets. The OCR signal is remarkably low-dimensional: PC1 captures 72.9% of variance. Crucially, principal component analysis (PCA) directions learned on one dataset transfer to others, demonstrating shared text-processing pathways. Surprisingly, in models with modular OCR circuits (notably Qwen3-VL-4B), OCR removal can improve counting performance (up to +6.9 percentage points), suggesting OCR interferes with other visual processing in sufficiently modular architectures."}

Prior work has explored modifications such as attention sinks or gating mechanisms, but these approaches provide only limited or indirect control over attention reweighting. We propose Affine-Scaled Attention, a simple extension to standard attention that introduces input-dependent scaling and a corresponding bias term applied to softmax-normalized attention weights. This design relaxes the strict normalization constraint while maintaining aggregation of value representations, allowing the model to adjust both the relative distribution and the scale of attention in a controlled manner.\n  We empirically evaluate Affine-Scaled Attention in large-scale language model pretraining across multiple model sizes. Experimental results show consistent improvements in training stability, optimization behavior, and downstream task performance compared to standard softmax attention and attention sink baselines. These findings suggest that modest reweighting of attention outputs provides a practical and effective way to improve attention behavior in Transformer models."}

By integrating C-ToBI boundary annotation with Dependency Grammar analysis, we examined both the quantity of prosodic boundaries and their mapping to syntactic relations. Results reveal a non-linear acquisition: although high-proficiency learners (VNH) converge to the native baseline in boundary quantity at the Major Phrase level (B3), their structural mapping significantly diverges. Specifically, VNH demote the prosodic boundary at the Subject-Verb (SBV) interface (Major Phrase B3 -> Prosodic Word B1), while erroneously promoting the boundary at the Verb-Object (VOB) interface (Prosodic Word B1 -> Major Phrase B3). This strategy allows learners to maintain high long phrasal output at the expense of structural accuracy. This results in a distorted prosodic hierarchy where the native pattern is inverted."}

The decoder has no learned use for these directions; their presence is noise.\n  We formalize this as a mismatched decoder problem: a decoder trained on text can only extract information along text-aligned directions. Accessible information is bounded by the Generalized Mutual Information (GMI), with degradation scaling with distributional distance and decoder sensitivity. The bound is a property of the decoder's scoring rule, not of any particular architecture; it applies whether non-text inputs arrive through a learned projection, a discrete codebook, or no explicit adapter at all. We validate this across five models spanning speech and vision. A controlled experiment (two Prismatic VLMs differing only in encoder text-alignment) confirms the bottleneck is the decoder's scoring rule, not the encoder or projection. A LoRA intervention demonstrates the fix: training with an emotion objective improves emotion accessibility ($+$7.5%) without affecting other attributes, confirming that the training objective determines what becomes accessible."}

Using linear attention models, we provide a theoretical analysis that characterizes how fine-tuning objectives modify attention parameters and identifies conditions under which this leads to degraded few-shot performance. We show that fine-tuning all attention parameters can harm in-context learning, whereas restricting updates to the value matrix improves zero-shot performance while preserving in-context learning.

In contrast, genuinely non-AR generation is promising because it removes AR's sequential bottleneck, better exploiting parallel hardware to reduce synchronization/communication overhead and improve latency scaling with output length. We argue that a primary driver of AR-like decoding is a mismatch between DLM objectives and the highly sequential structure of widely used training data, including standard pretraining corpora and long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision. Motivated by this diagnosis, we propose NAP (Non-Autoregressive Parallel DLMs), a proof-of-concept, data-centric approach that better aligns supervision with non-AR parallel decoding. NAP curates examples as multiple independent reasoning trajectories and couples them with a parallel-forced decoding strategy that encourages multi-token parallel updates. Across math reasoning benchmarks, NAP yields stronger performance under parallel decoding than DLMs trained on standard long CoT data, with gains growing as parallelism increases. Our results suggest that revisiting data and supervision is a principled direction for mitigating AR-like behavior and moving toward genuinely non-autoregressive parallel generation in DLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/pixeli99/NAP."}

We propose the Discourse-Aware Dual-Track Streaming Response (DDTSR) framework, a low-latency architecture that enables listen-while-thinking and speak-while-thinking. DDTSR is built upon three key mechanisms: (1) connective-guided small-large model synergy, where an auxiliary small model generates minimal-committal discourse connectives while a large model performs knowledge-intensive reasoning in parallel; (2) streaming-based cross-modal collaboration, which dynamically overlaps ASR, LLM inference, and TTS to advance the earliest speakable moment; and (3) curriculum-learning-based discourse continuity enhancement, which maintains coherence and logical consistency between early responses and subsequent reasoning outputs. Experiments on two spoken dialogue benchmarks demonstrate that DDTSR reduces response latency by 19%-51% while preserving discourse quality. Further analysis shows that DDTSR functions as a plug-and-play module compatible with diverse LLM backbones, and remains robust across varying utterance lengths, indicating strong practicality and scalability for real-time spoken interaction."}

We present SPARTA, an end-to-end construction framework that automatically generates large-scale Table-Text QA benchmarks with lightweight human validation, requiring only one quarter of the annotation time of HybridQA. The framework first constructs a reference fact database by enriching each source table with grounding tables whose tuples are atomic facts automatically extracted from the accompanying unstructured passages, then synthesizes nested queries whose number of nested predicates matches the desired hop count. To ensure that every SQL statement is executable and that its verbalization yields a fluent, human-sounding question, we propose two novel techniques: provenance-based refinement, which rewrites any syntactically valid query that returns a non-empty result, and realistic-structure enforcement, which confines generation to post-order traversals of the query graph. The resulting pipeline produces thousands of high-fidelity question-answer pairs covering aggregations, grouping, and deep multi-hop reasoning across text and tables. On SPARTA, state-of-the-art models that reach over 70 F1 on HybridQA or over 50 F1 on OTT-QA drop by more than 30 F1 points, exposing fundamental weaknesses in current cross-modal reasoning.

We investigate the data underlying the popular VLMs OpenCLIP, LLaVA-1.5 and Molmo through the lens of theories from pragmatics, and find that reporting bias results in insufficient representation of four reasoning skills (spatial, temporal, negation, and counting), despite the corpora being of web-scale, and/or synthetically generated. With a set of curated benchmarks, we demonstrate that: (i) VLMs perform poorly on the aforementioned types of reasoning suppressed in the training data by reporting bias; (ii) contrary to popular belief, scaling data size, model size, and to multiple languages does not result in emergence of these skills by default; but, promisingly, (iii) incorporating annotations specifically collected to obtain tacit information is effective.

We start from two empirical observations. First, a systematic user study shows that people consistently prefer quotations that are ``unexpected yet rational'' in context, identifying novelty as a key desideratum. Second, we find that strong existing models struggle to fully understand the deep meanings of quotations. Inspired by defamiliarization theory, we therefore formalize quote recommendation as choosing contextually novel but semantically coherent quotations. We operationalize this objective with NovelQR, a novelty-driven quotation recommendation framework. A generative label agent first interprets each quotation and its surrounding context into multi-dimensional deep-meaning labels, enabling label-enhanced retrieval. A token-level novelty estimator then reranks candidates while mitigating auto-regressive continuation bias. Experiments on bilingual datasets spanning diverse real-world domains show that our system recommends quotations that human judges rate as more appropriate, more novel, and more engaging than other baselines, while matching or surpassing existing methods in novelty estimation."}

Yet their factual reliability in non-English web ecosystems remains poorly understood, particularly when answering real user queries. We introduce a fact-checking dataset of 12~161 Chinese Yes/No questions derived from real-world online search logs and develop a unified evaluation pipeline to compare three information-access paradigms: traditional search engines, standalone LLMs, and AI-generated overview modules. Our analysis reveals substantial differences in factual accuracy and topic-level variability across systems. By combining this performance with real-world Baidu Index statistics, we further estimate potential exposure to incorrect factual information of Chinese users across regions. These findings highlight structural risks in AI-mediated search and underscore the need for more reliable and transparent information-access tools for the digital world."}

A key bottleneck for developing generalizable text-to-SQL models is the lack of large-scale datasets with sufficient schema and query complexity, domain coverage, and task diversity. We introduce SQaLe: a large-scale semi-synthetic text-to-SQL dataset built on 135,875 relational database schemas expanded from a collection of real-world schemas, SchemaPile. We establish a principled generation pipeline which combines schema sampling, question synthesis, and SQL construction, and produce 517,676 high-quality (question, schema, query) triples. The SQaLe dataset captures realistic schema size variability, diverse query patterns, and natural language ambiguity while maintaining execution validity. We provide an analysis of its contents and characteristics, and find that SQaLe introduces the most realistic large-scale text-to-SQL dataset to date in comparison with existing benchmarks and datasets. We discuss how SQaLe enables our vision for data scaling and model generalization in text-to-SQL research.

However, current pipelines are limited by static chunking and flat retrieval: documents are split into short, predetermined, fixed-size chunks, embeddings are retrieved uniformly, and generation relies on whatever chunks are returned. This design brings challenges, as retrieval quality is highly sensitive to chunk size, often introduces noise from irrelevant or misleading chunks, and scales poorly to large corpora. We present SmartChunk retrieval, a query-adaptive framework for efficient and robust long-document question answering (QA). SmartChunk uses (i) a planner that predicts the optimal chunk abstraction level for each query, and (ii) a lightweight compression module that produces high-level chunk embeddings without repeated summarization. By adapting retrieval granularity on the fly, SmartChunk balances accuracy with efficiency and avoids the drawbacks of fixed strategies. Notably, our planner can reason about chunk abstractions through a novel reinforcement learning scheme, STITCH, which boosts accuracy and generalization. To reflect real-world applications, where users face diverse document types and query styles, we evaluate SmartChunk on five QA benchmarks plus one out-of-domain dataset. Across these evaluations, SmartChunk outperforms state-of-the-art RAG baselines, while reducing cost. Further analysis demonstrates strong scalability with larger corpora and consistent gains on out-of-domain datasets, highlighting its effectiveness as a general framework for adaptive retrieval."}

However, industrial recommender systems often benefit from restricting the output space to a constrained subset of items based on business logic (e.g. enforcing content freshness or product category), which standard autoregressive decoding cannot natively support. Moreover, existing constrained decoding methods that make use of prefix trees (Tries) incur severe latency penalties on hardware accelerators (TPUs/GPUs). In this work, we introduce STATIC (Sparse Transition Matrix-Accelerated Trie Index for Constrained Decoding), an efficient and scalable constrained decoding technique designed specifically for high-throughput LLM-based generative retrieval on TPUs/GPUs. By flattening the prefix tree into a static Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) matrix, we transform irregular tree traversals into fully vectorized sparse matrix operations, unlocking massive efficiency gains on hardware accelerators. We deploy STATIC on a large-scale industrial video recommendation platform serving billions of users. STATIC produces significant product metric impact with minimal latency overhead (0.033 ms per step and 0.25% of inference time), achieving a 948x speedup over a CPU trie implementation and a 47-1033x speedup over a hardware-accelerated binary-search baseline. Furthermore, the runtime overhead of STATIC remains extremely low across a wide range of practical configurations. To the best of our knowledge, STATIC enables the first production-scale deployment of strictly constrained generative retrieval. In addition, evaluation on academic benchmarks demonstrates that STATIC can considerably improve cold-start performance for generative retrieval.

Please refer to source code available at https://github.com/weAIDB/MoDora", "summary": "Semi-structured documents integrate diverse interleaved data elements (e.g., tables, charts, hierarchical paragraphs) arranged in various and often irregular layouts. These documents are widely observed across domains and account for a large portion of real-world data. However, existing methods struggle to support natural language question answering over these documents due to three main technical challenges: (1) The elements extracted by techniques like OCR are often fragmented and stripped of their original semantic context, making them inadequate for analysis. (2) Existing approaches lack effective representations to capture hierarchical structures within documents (e.g., associating tables with nested chapter titles) and to preserve layout-specific distinctions (e.g., differentiating sidebars from main content). (3) Answering questions often requires retrieving and aligning relevant information scattered across multiple regions or pages, such as linking a descriptive paragraph to table cells located elsewhere in the document.\n  To address these issues, we propose MoDora, an LLM-powered system for semi-structured document analysis. First, we adopt a local-alignment aggregation strategy to convert OCR-parsed elements into layout-aware components, and conduct type-specific information extraction for components with hierarchical titles or non-text elements. Second, we design the Component-Correlation Tree (CCTree) to hierarchically organize components, explicitly modeling inter-component relations and layout distinctions through a bottom-up cascade summarization process. Finally, we propose a question-type-aware retrieval strategy that supports (1) layout-based grid partitioning for location-based retrieval and (2) LLM-guided pruning for semantic-based retrieval. Experiments show MoDora outperforms baselines by 5.97%-61.07% in accuracy. The code is at https://github.com/weAIDB/MoDora."}
