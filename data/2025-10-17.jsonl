For BERT-style encoders,\nvarious studies have shown that contrastive learning (CL) can be more effective\nthan discriminative (classification) learning. However, for large language\nmodels (LLMs), classification via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which predicts\n''yes'' (resp.

In\nthis work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis between CL and\nSFT for reranking, taking the universal multimodal retrieval (UMR) as the\nexperimental playground.

In 100-persona experiments,\nscores ranged from 0.9065 to 0.7896, and the mean was 0.8656, which we adopt as\na benchmark threshold. xAI's Grok-3 is most consistent, while several\nlightweight models rank lowest. Consistency varies by topic: the job market is\nleast consistent, G7 world leaders most consistent, and issues like vaccines or\nthe Israeli-Palestinian conflict diverge by provider. These results show that\nboth the provider and the topic shape the factual consistency.

To investigate learners' emotional experiences, we\ngenerate zero-shot affect annotations from three frontier LLMs (Gemini, GPT-4o,\nClaude), including scalar ratings of valence, arousal, and\nlearning-helpfulness, along with free-text emotion labels. These estimates are\nfused through rank-weighted intra-model pooling and plurality consensus across\nmodels to produce robust emotion profiles.

Experiments show that THTB enables\nmodels trained on only 5% of the data to outperform full-dataset training,\nwhile achieving superior generalization compared with LLM-only selection. In\naddition, THTB provides effective annotation guidance in vertical domains,\nenabling a model trained on just 2% of the data to surpass models trained on\nmuch larger datasets, demonstrating strong potential for domain adaptation. Our\ncode, datasets, and models are available on\nhttps://github.com/DYJG-research/THTB."}

To quantify the nature of potential biases in\nLLMs, various works have applied Moral Foundations Theory (MFT), a framework\nthat categorizes human moral reasoning into five dimensions: Harm, Fairness,\nIngroup Loyalty, Authority, and Purity. Previous research has used the MFT to\nmeasure differences in human participants along political, national, and\ncultural lines.

Therefore, we\npresent BioMedSearch, a multi-source biomedical information retrieval framework\nbased on LLMs. The method integrates literature retrieval, protein database and\nweb search access to support accurate and efficient handling of complex\nbiomedical queries. Through sub-queries decomposition, keywords extraction,\ntask graph construction, and multi-source information filtering, BioMedSearch\ngenerates high-quality question-answering results. To evaluate the accuracy of\nquestion answering, we constructed a multi-level dataset, BioMedMCQs,\nconsisting of 3,000 questions.

For BERT-style encoders,\nvarious studies have shown that contrastive learning (CL) can be more effective\nthan discriminative (classification) learning. However, for large language\nmodels (LLMs), classification via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which predicts\n''yes'' (resp. ''no'') token for relevant (resp. irrelevant) pairs, appears\nmore promising as it aligns well with the generative nature of LLMs. This\ndivergence raises a central question: which objective is intrinsically better\nsuited to LLM-based reranking, and what mechanism underlies the difference? In\nthis work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis between CL and\nSFT for reranking, taking the universal multimodal retrieval (UMR) as the\nexperimental playground. We first decompose the objectives into two components:\nweight, which controls the magnitude of those updates, and direction, which\nguides the model updates, then present a unified framework for understanding\ntheir interactions. Through probing experiments, we find that SFT provides a\nsubstantially stronger weighting scheme than CL, whereas the preferred scoring\ndirection shows no clear winner.

Prior methods' decoders recompute QKV for all\ntokens at every denoising step and layer, despite KV states changing little\nacross most steps, especially in shallow layers, leading to substantial\nredundancy. We make three observations: (1) distant ${\\bf MASK}$ tokens\nprimarily act as a length-bias and can be cached block-wise beyond the active\nprediction window; (2) KV dynamics increase with depth, suggesting that\nselective refresh starting from deeper layers is sufficient; and (3) the\nmost-attended token exhibits the smallest KV drift, providing a conservative\nlower bound on cache change for other tokens. Building on these, we propose\n${\\bf Elastic-Cache}$, a training-free, architecture-agnostic strategy that\njointly decides ${when}$ to refresh (via an attention-aware drift test on the\nmost-attended token) and ${where}$ to refresh (via a depth-aware schedule that\nrecomputes from a chosen layer onward while reusing shallow-layer caches and\noff-window MASK caches). Unlike fixed-period schemes, Elastic-Cache performs\nadaptive, layer-aware cache updates for diffusion LLMs, reducing redundant\ncomputation and accelerating decoding with negligible loss in generation\nquality. Experiments on LLaDA-Instruct, LLaDA-1.5, and LLaDA-V across\nmathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate consistent\nspeedups: $8.7\\times$ on GSM8K (256 tokens), $45.1\\times$ on longer sequences,\nand $4.8\\times$ on HumanEval, while consistently maintaining higher accuracy\nthan the baseline. Our method achieves significantly higher throughput\n($6.8\\times$ on GSM8K) than existing confidence-based approaches while\npreserving generation quality, enabling practical deployment of diffusion LLMs."}
