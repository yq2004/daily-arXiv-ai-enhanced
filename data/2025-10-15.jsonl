In this work, we explore whether this brittleness is\na direct result of unstable internal knowledge representations. To explore this\nquestion, we build on previous work showing that LLM representations encode\nstatement truthfulness -- i.e., true, factual statements can be easily\nseparated from false, inaccurate ones. Specifically, we test the robustness of\nlearned knowledge by evaluating representation separability on samples that\nhave undergone superficial transformations to drive them out-of-distribution\n(OOD), such as typos or reformulations.

Our results reveal that internal representations of statement\ntruthfulness collapse as the samples' presentations become less similar to\nthose seen during pre-training. While LLMs can often distinguish between true\nand false statements when they closely resemble the pre-training data, this\nability is highly dependent on the statement's exact surface form.

Multi-turn dialogues, which are more\ncommon in everyday interactions, pose a greater risk than single prompts;\nhowever, existing benchmarks do not adequately consider this situation. To\nencourage the community to focus on the safety issues of these models in\nmulti-turn dialogues, we introduce SafeMT, a benchmark that features dialogues\nof varying lengths generated from harmful queries accompanied by images. This\nbenchmark consists of 10,000 samples in total, encompassing 17 different\nscenarios and four jailbreak methods. Additionally, we propose Safety Index\n(SI) to evaluate the general safety of MLLMs during conversations. We assess\nthe safety of 17 models using this benchmark and discover that the risk of\nsuccessful attacks on these models increases as the number of turns in harmful\ndialogues rises.

To fix this, we introduce the Credal Transformer,\nwhich replaces standard attention with a Credal Attention Mechanism (CAM) based\non evidential theory. CAM produces a \"credal set\" (a set of distributions)\ninstead of a single attention vector, with the set's size directly measuring\nmodel uncertainty. We implement this by re-conceptualizing attention scores as\nevidence masses for a Dirichlet distribution: sufficient evidence recovers\nstandard attention, while insufficient evidence yields a diffuse distribution,\nrepresenting ambiguity. Empirically, the Credal Transformer identifies\nout-of-distribution inputs, quantifies ambiguity, and significantly reduces\nconfident errors on unanswerable questions by abstaining.

Kato"], "title": "Simple Projection Variants Improve ColBERT Performance", "comment": null, "summary": "Multi-vector dense retrieval methods like ColBERT systematically use a\nsingle-layer linear projection to reduce the dimensionality of individual\nvectors. In this study, we explore the implications of the MaxSim operator on\nthe gradient flows of the training of multi-vector models and show that such a\nsimple linear projection has inherent, if non-critical, limitations in this\nsetting. We then discuss the theoretical improvements that could result from\nreplacing this single-layer projection with well-studied alternative\nfeedforward linear networks (FFN), such as deeper, non-linear FFN blocks, GLU\nblocks, and skip-connections, could alleviate these limitations. Through the\ndesign and systematic evaluation of alternate projection blocks, we show that\nbetter-designed final projections positively impact the downstream performance\nof ColBERT models. We highlight that many projection variants outperform the\noriginal linear projections, with the best-performing variants increasing\naverage performance on a range of retrieval benchmarks across domains by over 2\nNDCG@10 points. We then conduct further exploration on the individual\nparameters of these projections block in order to understand what drives this\nempirical performance, highlighting the particular importance of upscaled\nintermediate projections and residual connections. As part of these ablation\nstudies, we show that numerous suboptimal projection variants still outperform\nthe traditional single-layer projection across multiple benchmarks, confirming\nour hypothesis. Finally, we observe that this effect is consistent across\nrandom seeds, further confirming that replacing the linear layer of ColBERT\nmodels is a robust, drop-in upgrade."}

As an emerging form of RAG, parametric\nretrieval-augmented generation (PRAG) encodes documents as model parameters\n(i.e., LoRA modules) and injects these representations into the model during\ninference, enabling interaction between the LLM and documents at parametric\nlevel. Compared with directly placing documents in the input context, PRAG is\nmore efficient and has the potential to offer deeper model-document\ninteraction. Despite its growing attention, the mechanism underlying parametric\ninjection remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic\nstudy of PRAG to clarify the role of parametric injection, showing that\nparameterized documents capture only partial semantic information of documents,\nand relying on them alone yields inferior performance compared to interaction\nat text level. However, these parametric representations encode high-level\ndocument information that can enhance the model's understanding of documents\nwithin the input context. When combined parameterized documents with textual\ndocuments, the model can leverage relevant information more effectively and\nbecome more robust to noisy inputs, achieving better performance than either\nsource alone. We recommend jointly using parameterized and textual documents\nand advocate for increasing the information content of parametric\nrepresentations to advance PRAG."}
