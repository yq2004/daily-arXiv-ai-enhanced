On the Stochastic Nature and Abductive Appearance of Large Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "This article looks at how reasoning works in current Large Language Models (LLMs) that function using the token-completion method. It examines their stochastic nature and their similarity to human abductive reasoning. The argument is that these LLMs create text based on learned patterns rather than performing actual abductive reasoning. When their output seems abductive, this is largely because they are trained on human-generated texts that include reasoning structures. Examples are used to show how LLMs can produce plausible ideas, mimic commonsense reasoning, and give explanatory answers without being grounded in truth, semantics, verification, or understanding, and without performing any real abductive reasoning. This dual nature, where the models have a stochastic base but appear abductive in use, has important consequences for how LLMs are evaluated and applied. They can assist with generating ideas and supporting human thinking, but their outputs must be critically assessed because they cannot identify truth or verify their explanations. The article concludes by addressing five objections to these points, noting some limitations in the analysis, and offering an overall evaluation."}

We present a novel question generation pipeline that leverages both the text generation and the probabilistic reasoning abilities of SLMs to generate high-quality questions. Adopting a \"generate-then-validate\" strategy, our pipeline first performs expansive generation to create an abundance of candidate questions and refine them through selective validation based on novel probabilistic reasoning. We conducted two evaluation studies, one with seven human experts and the other with a large language model (LLM), to assess the quality of the generated questions. Most judges (humans or LLMs) agreed that the generated questions had clear answers and generally aligned well with the intended learning objectives. Our findings suggest that an SLM can effectively generate high-quality questions when guided by a well-designed pipeline that leverages its strengths."}

This study establishes that this bottleneck arises from existing generative paradigms succumbing to the Statistical Smoothing Trap, a phenomenon that overlooks the high-entropy information acquisition and structured cognitive processes integral to expert-level writing. To address this limitation, we propose the DeepNews Framework, an agentic workflow that explicitly models the implicit cognitive processes of seasoned financial journalists. The framework integrates three core modules: first, a dual-granularity retrieval mechanism grounded in information foraging theory, which enforces a 10:1 saturated information input ratio to mitigate hallucinatory outputs; second, schema-guided strategic planning, a process leveraging domain expert knowledge bases (narrative schemas) and Atomic Blocks to forge a robust logical skeleton; third, adversarial constraint prompting, a technique deploying tactics including Rhythm Break and Logic Fog to disrupt the probabilistic smoothness inherent in model-generated text. Experiments delineate a salient Knowledge Cliff in deep financial reporting: content truthfulness collapses when retrieved context falls below 15,000 characters, while a high-redundancy input exceeding 30,000 characters stabilizes the Hallucination-Free Rate (HFR) above 85%. In an ecological validity blind test conducted with a top-tier Chinese technology media outlet, the DeepNews system--built on a previous-generation model (DeepSeek-V3-0324)-achieved a 25% submission acceptance rate, significantly outperforming the 0% acceptance rate of zero-shot generation by a state-of-the-art (SOTA) model (GPT-5)."}

In this work, we propose a two-stage prompting framework that infers both explicit (e.g., user-stated preferences) and implicit (e.g., demographic or stylistic cues) personas directly from short review texts. These inferred persona attributes are then incorporated into the response generation prompt to produce user-tailored replies. To encourage diverse yet faithful generations, we adjust decoding temperature during inference. We evaluate our method using a real-world dataset collected from a Korean food delivery app, and assess its impact on precision, diversity, and semantic consistency.

STARS combines several innovations: dual-memory user embeddings that separate long-term preferences from short-term session intent; semantic item tokens that fuse pretrained text embeddings, learnable deltas, and LLM-derived attribute tags, strengthening content-based matching, long-tail coverage, and cold-start performance; context-aware scoring with learned calendar and event offsets; and a latency-conscious two-stage retrieval pipeline that performs offline embedding generation and online maximum inner-product search with filtering, enabling tens-of-milliseconds response times. In offline evaluations on production-scale data, STARS improves Hit@5 by more than 75 percent relative to our existing LambdaMART system. A large-scale A/B test on 6 million visits shows statistically significant lifts, including Total Orders +0.8%, Add-to-Cart on Home +2.0%, and Visits per User +0.5%.

In this paper, we study the safety degradation that comes with adapting LLMs to new tasks. We attribute this safety compromise to catastrophic forgetting and frame the problem of preserving safety when fine-tuning as a continual learning (CL) problem. We consider the fine-tuning-as-a-service setup where the user uploads their data to a service provider to get a customized model that excels on the user's selected task. We adapt several CL approaches from the literature and systematically evaluate their ability to mitigate safety degradation. These include regularization-based, memory-based, and model merging approaches. We consider two scenarios, (1) benign user data and (2) poisoned user data. Our results demonstrate that CL approaches consistently achieve lower attack success rates than standard fine-tuning. Among these, DER outperforms both other CL methods and existing safety-preserving baselines while maintaining task utility. These findings generalize across three downstream tasks (GSM8K, SST2, Code) and three model families (LLaMA2-7B, Mistral-7B, Gemma-2B), establishing CL as a practical solution to preserve safety."}

These HID embeddings effectively learn collaborative information from historical user-item interactions, making them vulnerable to situations where most items are rarely consumed (the long-tail problem). Recent methods that incorporate auxiliary information often suffer from noisy collaborative sharing caused by co-occurrence signals or semantic homogeneity caused by flat dense embeddings. Semantic IDs (SIDs), with their capability of code sharing and multi-granular semantic modeling, provide a promising alternative. However, the collaborative overwhelming phenomenon hinders the further development of SID-based methods. The quantization mechanisms commonly compromise the uniqueness of identifiers required for modeling head items, creating a performance seesaw between head and tail items. To address this dilemma, we propose \\textbf{\\name}, a novel framework that harmonizes the SID and HID. Specifically, we devise a dual-branch modeling architecture that enables the model to capture both the multi-granular semantics within SID while preserving the unique collaborative identity of HID. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-level alignment strategy that bridges the two representations, facilitating knowledge transfer and supporting robust preference modeling. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that \\name~ effectively balances recommendation quality for both head and tail items while surpassing the existing baselines. The implementation code can be found online\\footnote{https://github.com/ziwliu8/H2Rec}."}

Although a variety of static medical question-answering (QA) benchmarks have been proposed, many aspects remain underexplored, such as the effectiveness of LLMs in generating responses in dynamic, interactive clinical multi-turn conversation situations and the identification of multi-faceted evaluation strategies beyond simple accuracy. However, formally evaluating a dynamic, interactive clinical situation is hindered by its vast combinatorial space of possible patient states and interaction trajectories, making it difficult to standardize and quantitatively measure such scenarios. Here, we introduce AutoMedic, a multi-agent simulation framework that enables automated evaluation of LLMs as clinical conversational agents. AutoMedic transforms off-the-shelf static QA datasets into virtual patient profiles, enabling realistic and clinically grounded multi-turn clinical dialogues between LLM agents. The performance of various clinical conversational agents is then assessed based on our CARE metric, which provides a multi-faceted evaluation standard of clinical conversational accuracy, efficiency/strategy, empathy, and robustness. Our findings, validated by human experts, demonstrate the validity of AutoMedic as an automated evaluation framework for clinical conversational agents, offering practical guidelines for the effective development of LLMs in conversational medical applications."}

While existing approaches treat this as an external confounding factor, we reveal that popularity bias is an intrinsic geometric artifact of Bayesian Pairwise Ranking (BPR) optimization in CF models. Through rigorous mathematical analysis, we prove that BPR systematically organizes item embeddings along a dominant \"popularity direction\" where embedding magnitudes directly correlate with interaction frequency. This geometric distortion forces user embeddings to simultaneously handle two conflicting tasks-expressing genuine preference and calibrating against global popularity-trapping them in suboptimal configurations that favor popular items regardless of individual tastes. We propose Directional Decomposition and Correction (DDC), a universally applicable framework that surgically corrects this embedding geometry through asymmetric directional updates. DDC guides positive interactions along personalized preference directions while steering negative interactions away from the global popularity direction, disentangling preference from popularity at the geometric source. Extensive experiments across multiple BPR-based architectures demonstrate that DDC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art debiasing methods, reducing training loss to less than 5% of heavily-tuned baselines while achieving superior recommendation quality and fairness.

However, these advancements remain largely limited to English, reducing their accessibility for non--English speakers. It is essential to extend these capabilities to a broader range of languages. This paper explores the challenges of adapting an English-trained VLM to different languages. To this end, we will explore and compare different methods for their performance and computational cost. We consider a translation-based pipeline, LoRA finetuning, and a two-stage finetuning strategy that separates vision adaptation from language adaptation. To evaluate these methods, we use a combination of standard multimodal benchmarks translated into the target language and manual assessments by native experts. The results reveal that dataset translation remains a major bottleneck in multilingual VLM performance, with data quality limiting the effectiveness of training and evaluation. These findings suggest that future efforts should focus on native-language dataset collection and improved translation strategies."}

We present the Confucius Code Agent (CCA), an open-sourced AI software engineer that can operate at an industrial scale. CCA is built atop the Confucius SDK, an open-sourced agent development platform designed around three complementary perspectives: Agent Experience (AX), User Experience (UX), and Developer Experience (DX). The SDK introduces a unified orchestrator with hierarchical working memory for long-context reasoning, a persistent note-taking system for cross-session continual learning, and a modular extension module for robust tool use. Moreover, a meta-agent automates the synthesis, evaluation, and refinement of agent configurations through a build-test-improve loop, enabling rapid agent development on new tasks, environments, and tool stacks. Instantiated on Confucius SDK with these mechanisms, CCA delivers strong performance on real-world software engineering tasks. On SWE-Bench-Pro, CCA achieves a state-of-the-art Resolve@1 performance of 54.3%, substantially improving over prior coding agents. Together, the Confucius SDK and CCA provide a transparent, extensible, and reproducible foundation for AI agents, bridge gaps between research prototypes and production-grade systems, and support agent development and deployment at industrial scale."}

Sliding window attention (SWA) reduces this cost to linear complexity, but naively enabling complete SWA at inference-time for models pretrained with full attention (FA) causes severe long-context performance degradation due to training-inference mismatch. This makes us wonder: Can FA-pretrained LLMs be well adapted to SWA without pretraining? We investigate this by proposing Sliding Window Attention Adaptation (SWAA), a set of practical recipes that combine five methods for better adaptation: (1) applying SWA only during prefilling; (2) preserving \"sink\" tokens; (3) interleaving FA/SWA layers; (4) chain-of-thought (CoT); and (5) fine-tuning. Our experiments show that SWA adaptation is feasible while non-trivial: no single method suffices, yet specific synergistic combinations effectively recover the original long-context performance.

To address these limitations, we propose CoopRAG, a novel RAG framework for the question answering task in which a retriever and an LLM work cooperatively with each other by exchanging informative knowledge, and the earlier and later layers of the retriever model work cooperatively with each other to accurately rank the retrieved documents relevant to a given query. In this framework, we (i) unroll a question into sub-questions and a reasoning chain in which uncertain positions are masked, (ii) retrieve the documents relevant to the question augmented with the sub-questions and the reasoning chain, (iii) rerank the documents by contrasting layers of the retriever, and (iv) reconstruct the reasoning chain by filling the masked positions via the LLM.

These tools generate \"tortured phrases\", statistically improbable synonyms (e.g. \"counterfeit consciousness\" for \"artificial intelligence\"), that preserve the local grammar while obscuring the original source. Most existing detection methods depend heavily on static blocklists or general-domain language models, which suffer from high false-negative rates for novel obfuscations and cannot determine the source of the plagiarized content. In this paper, we propose Semantic Reconstruction of Adversarial Plagiarism (SRAP), a framework designed not only to detect these anomalies but to mathematically recover the original terminology. We use a two-stage architecture: (1) statistical anomaly detection with a domain-specific masked language model (SciBERT) using token-level pseudo-perplexity, and (2) source-based semantic reconstruction using dense vector retrieval (FAISS) and sentence-level alignment (SBERT). Experiments on a parallel corpus of adversarial scientific text show that while zero-shot baselines fail completely (0.00 percent restoration accuracy), our retrieval-augmented approach achieves 23.67 percent restoration accuracy, significantly outperforming baseline methods. We also show that static decision boundaries are necessary for robust detection in jargon-heavy scientific text, since dynamic thresholding fails under high variance. SRAP enables forensic analysis by linking obfuscated expressions back to their most probable source documents."}

Causal reasoning demands multihop composition and strict conjunctive control, and reliance on spurious lexical relations of the input could provide misleading results. We hypothesize that, due to their ability to project the input into a latent space, encoder and encoder decoder architectures are better suited for said multihop conjunctive reasoning versus decoder only models. To do this, we compare fine-tuned versions of all the aforementioned architectures with zero and few shot ICL in both natural language and non natural language scenarios. We find that ICL alone is insufficient for reliable causal reasoning, often overfocusing on irrelevant input features. In particular, decoder only models are noticeably brittle to distributional shifts, while finetuned encoder and encoder decoder models can generalize more robustly across our tests, including the non natural language split. Both architectures are only matched or surpassed by decoder only architectures at large scales.

Yet, when extended to subjective and open-ended domains such as role play, existing reward models exhibit severe degradation, struggling to capture nuanced and persona-grounded human judgments. To address this gap, we introduce RoleRMBench, the first systematic benchmark for reward modeling in role-playing dialogue, covering seven fine-grained capabilities from narrative management to role consistency and engagement. Evaluation on RoleRMBench reveals large and consistent gaps between general-purpose reward models and human judgment, particularly in narrative and stylistic dimensions. We further propose RoleRM, a reward model trained with Continuous Implicit Preferences (CIP), which reformulates subjective evaluation as continuous consistent pairwise supervision under multiple structuring strategies. Comprehensive experiments show that RoleRM surpasses strong open- and closed-source reward models by over 24% on average, demonstrating substantial gains in narrative coherence and stylistic fidelity. Our findings highlight the importance of continuous preference representation and annotation consistency, establishing a foundation for subjective alignment in human-centered dialogue systems."}

To address these challenges, we present AgriGPT-Omni, an agricultural omni-framework that integrates speech, vision, and text in a unified framework. First, we construct a scalable data synthesis and collection pipeline that converts agricultural texts and images into training data, resulting in the largest agricultural speech dataset to date, including 492K synthetic and 1.4K real speech samples across six languages. Second, based on this, we train the first agricultural omni-model via a three-stage paradigm: textual knowledge injection, progressive multimodal alignment, and GRPO-based reinforcement learning, enabling unified reasoning across languages and modalities. Third, we propose AgriBench-Omni-2K, the first tri-modal benchmark for agriculture, covering diverse speech-vision-text tasks and multilingual slices, with standardized protocols and reproducible tools. Experiments show that AgriGPT-Omni significantly outperforms general-purpose baselines on multilingual and multimodal reasoning as well as real-world speech understanding. All models, data, benchmarks, and code will be released to promote reproducible research, inclusive agricultural intelligence, and sustainable AI development for low-resource regions."}

Using the Serbian language as a case, this study examines the structural, historical, and sociotechnical factors shaping language technology development for low resource languages in the AI age. Drawing on semi structured interviews with ten scholars and practitioners, including linguists, digital humanists, and AI developers, it traces challenges rooted in historical destruction of Serbian textual heritage, intensified by contemporary issues that drive reductive, engineering first approaches prioritizing functionality over linguistic nuance. These include superficial transliteration, reliance on English-trained models, data bias, and dataset curation lacking cultural specificity. To address these challenges, the study proposes Data Care, a framework grounded in CARE principles (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics), that reframes bias mitigation from a post hoc technical fix to an integral component of corpus design, annotation, and governance, and positions Data Care as a replicable model for building inclusive, sustainable, and culturally grounded language technologies in contexts where traditional LLM development reproduces existing power imbalances and cultural blind spots."}

Regulations such as the European AI Act require identifying and mitigating biases against protected groups in data, with the ultimate goal of preventing unfair model outputs. However, practical guidance and operationalization are lacking. We propose a comprehensive data bias detection and mitigation pipeline comprising four components that address two data bias types, namely representation bias and (explicit) stereotypes for a configurable sensitive attribute. First, we leverage LLM-generated word lists created based on quality criteria to detect relevant group labels. Second, representation bias is quantified using the Demographic Representation Score. Third, we detect and mitigate stereotypes using sociolinguistically informed filtering. Finally, we compensate representation bias through Grammar- and Context-Aware Counterfactual Data Augmentation. We conduct a two-fold evaluation using the examples of gender, religion and age. First, the effectiveness of each individual component on data debiasing is evaluated through human validation and baseline comparison. The findings demonstrate that we successfully reduce representation bias and (explicit) stereotypes in a text dataset. Second, the effect of data debiasing on model bias reduction is evaluated by bias benchmarking of several models (0.6B-8B parameters), fine-tuned on the debiased text dataset. This evaluation reveals that LLMs fine-tuned on debiased data do not consistently show improved performance on bias benchmarks, exposing critical gaps in current evaluation methodologies and highlighting the need for targeted data manipulation to address manifested model bias."}

We present TRIDENT (Transcription and Routing Intelligence for Dispatcher-Empowered National Triage), a three-layer dispatcher-support architecture designed to structure emergency call inputs for human application of established triage protocols (the ESI for routine operations and START for mass casualty events), even when automatic speech recognition fails.\n  The system combines Caribbean-accent-tuned ASR, local entity extraction via large language models, and bio-acoustic distress detection to provide dispatchers with three complementary signals: transcription confidence, structured clinical entities, and vocal stress indicators. Our key insight is that low ASR confidence, rather than representing system failure, serves as a valuable queue prioritization signal -- particularly when combined with elevated vocal distress markers indicating a caller in crisis whose speech may have shifted toward basilectal registers. A complementary insight drives the entity extraction layer: trained responders and composed bystanders may report life-threatening emergencies without elevated vocal stress, requiring semantic analysis to capture clinical indicators that paralinguistic features miss.\n  We describe the architectural design, theoretical grounding in psycholinguistic research on stress-induced code-switching, and deployment considerations for offline operation during disaster scenarios. This work establishes a framework for accent-resilient emergency AI that ensures Caribbean voices receive equitable access to established national triage protocols. Empirical validation on Caribbean emergency calls remains future work."}

Massively multilingual models still underperform compared to language-specific adaptations, especially at smaller model scales. In this work, we investigate scaling as an efficient strategy for adapting pretrained models to new target languages. Through comprehensive scaling ablations with approximately FLOP-matched models, we test whether upscaling an English base model enables more effective and resource-efficient adaptation than standard continued pretraining. We find that, once exposed to sufficient target-language data, larger upscaled models can match or surpass the performance of smaller models continually pretrained on much more data, demonstrating the benefits of scaling for data efficiency. Scaling also helps preserve the base model's capabilities in English, thus reducing catastrophic forgetting. Finally, we explore whether such scaled, language-specific models can be merged to construct modular and flexible multilingual systems. We find that while merging remains less effective than joint multilingual training, upscaled merges perform better than smaller ones. We observe large performance differences across merging methods, suggesting potential for improvement through merging approaches specialized for language-level integration."}

In many such settings, speakers of Indian languages frequently communicate using romanized text rather than native scripts, yet existing research rarely evaluates this orthographic variation using real-world data. We investigate how romanization impacts the reliability of LLMs in a critical domain: maternal and newborn healthcare triage. We benchmark leading LLMs on a real-world dataset of user-generated queries spanning five Indian languages and Nepali. Our results reveal consistent degradation in performance for romanized messages, with F1 scores trailing those of native scripts by 5-12 points. At our partner maternal health organization in India, this gap could cause nearly 2 million excess errors in triage. Crucially, this performance gap by scripts is not due to a failure in clinical reasoning. We demonstrate that LLMs often correctly infer the semantic intent of romanized queries. Nevertheless, their final classification outputs remain brittle in the presence of orthographic noise in romanized inputs. Our findings highlight a critical safety blind spot in LLM-based health systems: models that appear to understand romanized input may still fail to act on it reliably."}
