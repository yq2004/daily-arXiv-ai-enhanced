However, existing representation learning methods crafted for\nhandling billions of items in recommendation systems are unsuitable for game\nadvertising and recommendation. This is primarily due to game sparsity, where\nthe mere hundreds of games fall short for large-scale user representation\nlearning, and game imbalance, where user behaviors are overwhelmingly dominated\nby a handful of popular games. To address the sparsity issue, we introduce the\nUser Game Lifecycle (UGL), designed to enrich user behaviors in games.\nAdditionally, we propose two innovative strategies aimed at manipulating user\nbehaviors to more effectively extract both short and long-term interests. To\ntackle the game imbalance challenge, we present an Inverse Probability Masking\nstrategy for UGL representation learning. The offline and online experimental\nresults demonstrate that the UGL representations significantly enhance model by\nachieving a 1.83% AUC offline increase on average and a 21.67% CVR online\nincrease on average for game advertising and a 0.5% AUC offline increase and a\n0.82% ARPU online increase for in-game item recommendation."}

To address this, we restrict the latent space to the column space of\nthe LLM vocabulary, treating latent reasoning as a superposition over\nvocabulary probabilities. Once latent reasoning concludes, it collapses into an\neigenstate of explicit reasoning to yield the final answer. Based on this idea,\nwe propose Latent-SFT, a two-stage learning framework. In the first stage, we\ndesign two specialized attention masks to guide the Latent Token Encoder in\ngenerating latent tokens, allowing the LLM to produce the correct answer\nconditioned on them. In the second stage, the Latent Token Encoder is\ndiscarded, and the LLM is directly trained to generate these latent tokens\nautonomously for latent reasoning, optimized with KL and CE losses. Latent-SFT\nsets a new state of the art on GSM8k, matching explicit SFT performance while\ncutting reasoning chains by up to 4 times and outperforming prior latent\nmethods.

However,\nthese models often incur high computational costs, as both retrieval and\nreasoning tokens contribute substantially to the overall resource usage. In\nthis work, we make the following contributions: (1) we propose a\nretrieval-augmented reasoning model that dynamically adjusts the length of the\nretrieved document list based on the query and retrieval results; (2) we\ndevelop a cost-aware advantage function for training of efficient\nretrieval-augmented reasoning models through reinforcement learning; and (3) we\nexplore both memory- and latency-bound implementations of the proposed\ncost-aware framework for both proximal and group relative policy optimization\nalgorithms. We evaluate our approach on seven public question answering\ndatasets and demonstrate significant efficiency gains, without compromising\neffectiveness. In fact, we observed that the model latency decreases by ~16-20%\nacross datasets, while its effectiveness increases by ~5% on average, in terms\nof exact match."}

DLMs employ\ntransformer encoders with bidirectional attention, enabling parallel token\ngeneration while maintaining competitive performance. Although their efficiency\nand effectiveness have been extensively studied, the internal mechanisms that\ngovern DLMs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct an empirical\nanalysis of DLM attention patterns, focusing on the attention sinking\nphenomenon, an effect previously observed in various transformer-based\narchitectures. Our findings reveal that DLMs also exhibit attention sinks, but\nwith distinct characteristics. First, unlike in ARMs, the sink positions in\nDLMs tend to shift throughout the generation process, displaying a dynamic\nbehaviour. Second, while ARMs are highly sensitive to the removal of attention\nsinks, DLMs remain robust: masking sinks leads to only a minor degradation in\nperformance. These results provide new insights into the inner workings of\ndiffusion-based language models and highlight fundamental differences in how\nthey allocate and utilize attention compared to autoregressive models."}

This inquiry is motivated by the growing\ninadequacy of conventional evaluation practices, which often rely on\nfixed-format tasks with reference answers and struggle to capture the nuanced,\nsubjective, and open-ended nature of modern LLM behavior. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel alternative: automatic mutual evaluation, where\nLLMs assess each other's output through self-play and peer review. These peer\nassessments are then systematically compared with human voting behavior to\nevaluate their alignment with human judgment. Our framework incorporates\ngame-theoretic voting algorithms to aggregate peer reviews, enabling a\nprincipled investigation into whether model-generated rankings reflect human\npreferences. Empirical results reveal both convergences and divergences between\ntheoretical predictions and human evaluations, offering valuable insights into\nthe promises and limitations of mutual evaluation.

We provide theoretical and\nproof-of-concept experimental evidence suggesting that interaction and even\nobservations may not be necessary for sufficiently complex languages. One may\nbe able to evaluate translators solely by their English outputs, offering\npotential advantages in terms of safety, ethics, and cost.

A key challenge is identifying ``hallucinations,''\nfalse translations which may appear fluent and plausible. We propose using\nsegment-by-segment translation together with the classic NLP shuffle test to\nevaluate translators. The idea is to translate animal communication, turn by\nturn, and evaluate how often the resulting translations make more sense in\norder than permuted. Proof-of-concept experiments on data-scarce human\nlanguages and constructed languages demonstrate the potential utility of this\nevaluation methodology.

We study one simple setting in which\ntruth encoding can emerge: a data distribution where factual statements\nco-occur with other factual statements (and vice-versa), encouraging the model\nto learn this distinction in order to lower the LM loss on future tokens. We\ncorroborate this pattern with experiments in pretrained language models.\nFinally, in the toy setting we observe a two-phase learning dynamic: networks\nfirst memorize individual factual associations in a few steps, then -- over a\nlonger horizon -- learn to linearly separate true from false, which in turn\nlowers language-modeling loss. Together, these results provide both a\nmechanistic demonstration and an empirical motivation for how and why linear\ntruth representations can emerge in language models."}
