To overcome these limitations, we propose Diffusion-enhanced\nActor-Critic for Offline RL4RS (DAC4Rec), a novel framework that integrates\ndiffusion processes with reinforcement learning to model complex user\npreferences more effectively. DAC4Rec leverages the denoising capabilities of\ndiffusion models to enhance the robustness of offline RL algorithms and\nincorporates a Q-value-guided policy optimization strategy to better handle\nsuboptimal trajectories. Additionally, we introduce an energy-based sampling\nstrategy to reduce randomness during recommendation generation, ensuring more\ntargeted and reliable outcomes. We validate the effectiveness of DAC4Rec\nthrough extensive experiments on six real-world offline datasets and in an\nonline simulation environment, demonstrating its ability to optimize long-term\nuser preferences.

Prior works have focused on leveraging the\ngenerative capabilities of LLMs to improve GR, while overlooking that their\nreasoning capabilities could likewise help. This raises a key question: Can\nexplicit reasoning benefit GR? To investigate, we first conduct a preliminary\nstudy where an LLM is prompted to generate free-form chain-of-thought (CoT)\nreasoning before performing constrained docid decoding. Although this method\noutperforms standard GR, the generated reasoning tends to be verbose and poorly\naligned with the docid space. These limitations motivate the development of a\nreasoning mechanism better tailored to GR.\n  Therefore, we propose Reason-for-Retrieval (R4R), a reasoning-augmented\nframework for GR that converts free-form CoT reasoning into a compact,\nstructured format, and iteratively refines the reasoning during the retrieval\nprocess. R4R augments an existing GR method by leveraging a reasoning-capable\nLLM that has been instruction-tuned for GR. At inference time, R4R first uses\nthe LLM to generate an initial structured reasoning; then the same LLM\nalternates between (i) constrained decoding with the chosen GR method to\nproduce candidate docids and (ii) updating the reasoning based on retrieval\nresults to improve the next round.

However, most existing systems only regard this task as a simple\ntext translation task and follow a short-horizon paradigm, generating a query\nper turn without execution, explicit verification, and refinement, which leads\nto non-executable or incoherent outputs. We present MTSQL-R1, an agentic\ntraining framework for long-horizon multi-turn Text-to-SQL. We cast the task as\na Markov Decision Process (MDP) in which an agent interacts with (i) a database\nfor execution feedback and (ii) a persistent dialogue memory for coherence\nverification, performing an iterative propose to execute -> verify -> refine\ncycle until all checks pass. Experiments on COSQL and SPARC demonstrate that\nMTSQL-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the importance\nof environment-driven verification and memory-guided refinement for\nconversational semantic parsing.
