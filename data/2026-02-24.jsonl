Existing methods over-optimize citation fidelity while overlooking relevance to the user query, which degrades answer quality and robustness in real-world settings with noisy or irrelevant retrieved content. Moreover, the prevailing single-pass paradigm struggles to deliver optimal answers in long-form generation that requiring multiple citations. To address these limitations, we propose FineRef, a framework based on Fine-grained error Reflection, which explicitly teaches the model to self-identify and correct two key citation errors, mismatch and irrelevance, on a per-citation basis. FineRef follows a two-stage training strategy. The first stage instills an \"attempt-reflect-correct\" behavioral pattern via supervised fine-tuning, using fine-grained and controllable reflection data constructed by specialized lightweight models. An online self-reflective bootstrapping strategy is designed to improve generalization by iteratively enriching training data with verified, self-improving examples. To further enhance the self-reflection and correction capability, the second stage applies process-level reinforcement learning with a multi-dimensional reward scheme that promotes reflection accuracy, answer quality, and correction gain. Experiments on the ALCE benchmark demonstrate that FineRef significantly improves both citation performance and answer accuracy. Our 7B model outperforms GPT-4 by up to 18% in Citation F1 and 4% in EM Recall, while also surpassing the state-of-the-art model across key evaluation metrics. FineRef also exhibits strong generalization and robustness in domain transfer settings and noisy retrieval scenarios."}

This phase is frequently overlooked in Data Management Plans included in project proposals, despite its important role in ensuring reproducibility and preventing the need for retroactive reconstruction at the time of publication. Here we present Altar, a lightweight, domain-agnostic framework for structuring experimental data from the onset of a project without imposing rigid data models. Altar is built around the Sacred experiment-tracking model and captures experimental (meta)data and structures them. Parameters, metadata, curves and small files are stored in a flexible NoSQL database, while large raw data are maintained in dedicated storage and linked through unique identifiers, ensuring efficiency and traceability. This integration is composable with exiting workflows, allowing integration with minimial disruption of work habits. We document different pathways to use Altar based on users skillset (PhD students, Post-docs, Principal Investigators, Laboratory administrators, System administrators). While getting started with Altar does not require a specialized infrastructure, the framework can be easily deployed on a server and made publicly accessible when scaling up or preparing data for publication. By addressing the dynamic phase of research, Altar provides a practical bridge between exploratory experimentation and FAIR-aligned data sharing."}

In such settings, negative sampling plays a critical role in model training by constructing negative items that enable effective preference learning and ranking optimization. However, designing reliable negative sampling strategies remains challenging, as they must simultaneously ensure realness, hardness, and interpretability. To this end, we propose \\textbf{ICPNS (In-Community Popularity Negative Sampling)}, a novel framework that leverages user community structure to identify reliable and informative negative samples. Our approach is grounded in the insight that item exposure is driven by latent user communities. By identifying these communities and utilizing in-community popularity, ICPNS effectively approximates the probability of item exposure. Consequently, items that are popular within a user's community but remain unclicked are identified as more reliable true negatives. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that ICPNS yields consistent improvements on graph-based recommenders and competitive performance on MF-based models, outperforming representative negative sampling strategies under a unified evaluation protocol."}

However, these architectures remain structurally blind to explicit user intent: they struggle to adapt when a user's immediate goal (e.g., expressed via a natural language prompt) deviates from their historical habits. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the semantic reasoning to interpret such intent, existing integration paradigms force a dilemma: LLM-as-a-recommender paradigm sacrifices the efficiency and collaborative precision of ID-based retrieval, while Reranking methods are inherently bottlenecked by the recall capabilities of the underlying model. In this paper, we propose Decoupled Promptable Sequential Recommendation (DPR), a model-agnostic framework that empowers conventional sequential backbones to natively support Promptable Recommendation, the ability to dynamically steer the retrieval process using natural language without abandoning collaborative signals. DPR modulates the latent user representation directly within the retrieval space. To achieve this, we introduce a Fusion module to align the collaborative and semantic signals, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that disentangles the conflicting gradients from positive and negative steering, and a three-stage training strategy that progressively aligns the semantic space of prompts with the collaborative space. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DPR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in prompt-guided tasks while maintaining competitive performance in standard sequential recommendation scenarios."}

In this context, the practical reliability of such reports hinges on logical quality: whether the report's claims and arguments are explicitly supported and can be trusted as a basis for downstream use, rather than merely appearing fluent or informative. However, current evaluation frameworks largely overlook this requirement. To bridge this gap, we introduce ReportLogic, a benchmark that quantifies report-level logical quality through a reader-centric lens of auditability. Specifically, ReportLogic adopts a hierarchical taxonomy that evaluates whether readers can (1) trace an on-topic report structure with a unified analytical arc (Macro-Logic), (2) understand the progression with necessary context (Expositional-Logic), and (3) verify conclusions via explicit claim--support (Structural-Logic). Based on this taxonomy, we construct a human-annotated rubric-guided dataset and train an open-source LogicJudge for scalable evaluation. We further evaluate judge robustness via adversarial attacks, showing that off-the-shelf LLM judges are frequently influenced by superficial cues (e.g., verbosity), and reasoning modes can mask broken support relations. Overall, our results provide actionable guidance for building more robust logic evaluators and improving the logical reliability of LLM-generated reports."}

To address these limitations, we propose an adaptive multi-agent retrieval framework that dynamically orchestrates specialized agents over multiple reasoning iterations based on the demands of each query. The framework includes: (1) a retrieval agent for scalable retrieval over large video corpora, (2) a reasoning agent for zero-shot contextual temporal reasoning, and (3) a query reformulation agent for refining ambiguous queries and recovering performance for those that degrade over iterations. These agents are dynamically coordinated by an orchestration agent, which leverages intermediate feedback and reasoning outcomes to guide execution. We also introduce a novel communication mechanism that incorporates retrieval-performance memory and historical reasoning traces to improve coordination and decision-making. Experiments on three TRECVid benchmarks spanning eight years show that our framework achieves a twofold improvement over CLIP4Clip and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin."}

We propose ConfSpec, a confidence-gated cascaded verification framework that resolves this trade-off. Our key insight is an asymmetry between generation and verification: while generating a correct reasoning step requires substantial model capacity, step-level verification is a constrained discriminative task for which small draft models are well-calibrated within their competence range, enabling high-confidence draft decisions to be accepted directly while selectively escalating uncertain cases to the large target model. Evaluation across diverse workloads shows that ConfSpec achieves up to 2.24$\\times$ end-to-end speedups while matching target-model accuracy. Our method requires no external judge models and is orthogonal to token-level speculative decoding, enabling further multiplicative acceleration."}

However, existing methods often suffer from one or more key limitations: processing different modalities in isolation, requiring complete multimodal data for each interaction during training, or independent learning of user and item representations. These factors contribute to increased complexity and potential misalignment between user and item embeddings. To address these challenges, we propose DReX, a unified multimodal recommendation framework that incrementally refines user and item representations by leveraging interaction-level features from multimodal feedback. Our model employs gated recurrent units to selectively integrate these fine-grained features into global representations. This incremental update mechanism provides three key advantages: (1) simultaneous modeling of both nuanced interaction details and broader preference patterns, (2) eliminates the need for separate user and item feature extraction processes, leading to enhanced alignment in their learned representation, and (3) inherent robustness to varying or missing modalities. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on three real-world datasets containing reviews and ratings as interaction modalities. By considering review text as a modality, our approach automatically generates interpretable keyword profiles for both users and items, which supplement the recommendation process with interpretable preference indicators. Experiment results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated datasets."}

Includes a dataset-free benchmark with full metric reporting", "summary": "Multi-agent language systems can exhibit a failure mode where a shared dominant context progressively absorbs individual semantics, yielding near-uniform behavior across agents. We study this effect under the name Asymptotic Semantic Collapse in Hierarchical Optimization. In a closed linguistic setting with a Dominant Anchor Node whose semantic state has effectively infinite inertia, we show that repeated interactions with Peripheral Agent Nodes drive an asymptotic alignment that minimizes a global loss. We model semantic states as points on a Riemannian manifold and analyze the induced projection dynamics. Two consequences follow. First, the limiting semantic configuration is insensitive to the optimization history: both smooth gradient-style updates and stochastic noisy updates converge to the same topological endpoint, establishing path independence at convergence. Second, the degree of context dependence controls information content: moving from atomic (independent) representations to fully entangled (context-bound) representations forces the node entropy, interpreted as available degrees of freedom, to vanish in the limit. The theory connects information-theoretic quantities with differential-geometric structure and suggests an interpretation as an immutable consensus rule that constrains agents to a shared semantic grammar. A lightweight dataset-free benchmark on an RWKV-7 13B GGUF checkpoint complements the analysis, reporting zero hash collisions, mean compliance of 0.50 under greedy decoding and 0.531 under stochastic decoding, and final Jaccard-to-anchor similarity values of 0.295 and 0.224, respectively."}

Existing approaches typically employ transformer-based architectures to process long sequences of user interactions, capturing preference shifts by modeling temporal relationships between items. However, these methods often overlook the influence of group-level features that capture the collective behavior of similar users. We hypothesize that explicitly modeling temporally evolving group features alongside individual user histories can significantly enhance next-item recommendation. Our approach introduces latent group representations, where each user's affiliation to these groups is modeled through learnable, time-varying membership weights. The membership weights at each timestep are computed by modeling shifts in user preferences through their interaction history, where we incorporate both short-term and long-term user preferences. We extract a set of statistical features that capture the dynamics of user behavior and further refine them through a series of transformations to produce the final drift-aware membership weights. A group-based representation is derived by weighting latent group embeddings with the learned membership scores. This representation is integrated with the user's sequential representation within the transformer block to jointly capture personal and group-level temporal dynamics, producing richer embeddings that lead to more accurate, context-aware recommendations. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, where it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art sequential recommendation methods."}

In industrial recommender systems, features play vital roles as they carry information for downstream models. Accurate feature importance estimation is critical because it helps identify the most useful feature subsets from thousands of feature candidates for online services. Such selection enables improved online performance while reducing computational cost. To address feature selection problems in deep learning, trainable gate-based and sensitivity-based methods have been proposed and proven effective in industrial practice. However, through the analysis of real-world cases, we identified three bias issues that cause feature importance estimation to rely on partial model layers, samples, or gradients, ultimately leading to inaccurate importance estimation. We refer to these as layer bias, baseline bias, and approximation bias. To mitigate these issues, we propose FairFS, a fair and accurate feature selection algorithm. FairFS regularizes feature importance estimated across all nonlinear transformation layers to address layer bias. It also introduces a smooth baseline feature close to the classifier decision boundary and adopts an aggregated approximation method to alleviate baseline and approximation biases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FairFS effectively mitigates these biases and achieves state-of-the-art feature selection performance."}

However, methods that avoid direct exposure to private data are bounded by an off-the-shelf, un-finetuned model, whose outputs often lack domain fidelity. Can we train an LLM to generate high-quality synthetic text without eyes-on access to individual private examples? In this work, we introduce Differentially Private Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (DP-RFT), an online reinforcement learning algorithm for synthetic data generation with LLMs. DP-RFT leverages DP-protected nearest-neighbor votes from an eyes-off private corpus as a reward signal for on-policy synthetic samples generated by an LLM.

Despite empirical gains, existing approaches largely drive intermediate reasoning states via target-dominant objectives without imposing explicit feasibility constraints. This results in latent drift, where reasoning trajectories deviate into implausible regions. We argue that effective recommendation reasoning should instead be viewed as navigation on a collaborative manifold rather than free-form latent refinement. To this end, we propose ManCAR (Manifold-Constrained Adaptive Reasoning), a principled framework that grounds reasoning within the topology of a global interaction graph. ManCAR constructs a local intent prior from the collaborative neighborhood of a user's recent actions, represented as a distribution over the item simplex. During training, the model progressively aligns its latent predictive distribution with this prior, forcing the reasoning trajectory to remain within the valid manifold. At test time, reasoning proceeds adaptively until the predictive distribution stabilizes, avoiding over-refinement. We provide a variational interpretation of ManCAR to theoretically validate its drift-prevention and adaptive test-time stopping mechanisms. Experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate that ManCAR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 46.88% relative improvement w.r.t. NDCG@10.

We introduced PolyFrame, our system for the MWE-2026 AdMIRe2 shared task on multimodal idiom disambiguation, featuring a unified pipeline for both image+text ranking (Subtask A) and text-only caption ranking (Subtask B). All model variants retain frozen CLIP-style vision--language encoders and the multilingual BGE M3 encoder, training only lightweight modules: a logistic regression and LLM-based sentence-type predictor, idiom synonym substitution, distractor-aware scoring, and Borda rank fusion. Starting from a CLIP baseline (26.7% Top-1 on English dev, 6.7% on English test), adding idiom-aware paraphrasing and explicit sentence-type classification increased performance to 60.0% Top-1 on English and 60.0% Top-1 (0.822 NDCG@5) in zero-shot transfer to Portuguese. On the multilingual blind test, our systems achieved average Top-1/NDCG scores of 0.35/0.73 for Subtask A and 0.32/0.71 for Subtask B across 15 languages.

Existing state-of-the-art methods primarily rely on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) solutions that construct personal context by retrieving relevant items from the user's profile. Existing methods use the user's query directly to retrieve personal documents, and such strategies often lead to surface-level personalization. We propose PR2 (Personalized Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning), a reinforcement learning framework that integrates reasoning and retrieval from personal context for personalization. PR2 learns adaptive retrieval-reasoning policies, determining when to retrieve, what evidence to retrieve from user profiles, and how to incorporate it into intermediate reasoning steps. By optimizing multi-turn reasoning trajectories under a personalized reward function, the framework reinforces reasoning paths that better align with user-specific preferences and contextual signals reflected by the reward model. Extensive experiments on the LaMP-QA benchmark using three LLMs show that PR2 consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving an average relative improvement of 8.8%-12% in personalized QA."}

The dataset comprises 36,000 posts across nine categories (Economic, Artistic, Sports, Political, Social, Health, Psychological, Historical, and Science & Technology), each containing 4,000 samples to ensure balanced class distribution. Data collection involved 60,000 raw posts from various Persian social media platforms, followed by rigorous preprocessing and hybrid annotation combining ChatGPT-based few-shot prompting with human verification. To mitigate class imbalance, we employed undersampling with semantic redundancy removal and advanced data augmentation strategies integrating lexical replacement and generative prompting. We benchmarked several models, including BiLSTM, XLM-RoBERTa (with LoRA and AdaLoRA adaptations), FaBERT, SBERT-based architectures, and the Persian-specific TookaBERT (Base and Large). Experimental results show that transformer-based models consistently outperform traditional neural networks, with TookaBERT-Large achieving the best performance (Precision: 0.9622, Recall: 0.9621, F1- score: 0.9621). Class-wise evaluation further confirms robust performance across all categories, though social and political texts exhibited slightly lower scores due to inherent ambiguity.

Claim verification, a.k.a. fact-checking, systems can help identify potential misinformation. However, their efficacy is limited by the knowledge sources that they rely on. Most automated claim verification systems depend on a single knowledge source and utilize the supporting evidence from that source; they ignore the disagreement of their source with others. This limits their knowledge coverage and transparency. To address these limitations, we present a novel system for open-domain claim verification (ODCV) that leverages large language models (LLMs), multi-perspective evidence retrieval, and cross-source disagreement analysis. Our approach introduces a novel retrieval strategy that collects evidence for both the original and the negated forms of a claim, enabling the system to capture supporting and contradicting information from diverse sources: Wikipedia, PubMed, and Google. These evidence sets are filtered, deduplicated, and aggregated across sources to form a unified and enriched knowledge base that better reflects the complexity of real-world information. This aggregated evidence is then used for claim verification using LLMs. We further enhance interpretability by analyzing model confidence scores to quantify and visualize inter-source disagreement. Through extensive evaluation on four benchmark datasets with five LLMs, we show that knowledge aggregation not only improves claim verification but also reveals differences in source-specific reasoning. Our findings underscore the importance of embracing diversity, contradiction, and aggregation in evidence for building reliable and transparent claim verification systems"}

However, constructing high-quality hypergraphs remains challenging due to the \\textit{scenario gap}: generic extractors struggle to generalize across diverse domains with specific jargon, while existing methods often fail to balance structural skeletons with fine-grained details. To bridge this gap, we propose \\textbf{Hyper-KGGen}, a skill-driven framework that reformulates extraction as a dynamic skill-evolving process. First, Hyper-KGGen employs a \\textit{coarse-to-fine} mechanism to systematically decompose documents, ensuring full-dimensional coverage from binary links to complex hyperedges. Crucially, it incorporates an \\textit{adaptive skill acquisition} module that actively distills domain expertise into a Global Skill Library. This is achieved via a stability-based feedback loop, where extraction stability serves as a relative reward signal to induce high-quality skills from unstable traces and missed predictions. Additionally, we present \\textbf{HyperDocRED}, a rigorously annotated benchmark for document-level knowledge hypergraph extraction. Experiments demonstrate that Hyper-KGGen significantly outperforms strong baselines, validating that evolved skills provide substantially richer guidance than static few-shot examples in multi-scenario settings."}

This manuscript specifies the formal model, assumptions, and tests that can refute the model.

The state-of-the-art multi-vector paradigm excels in performance but suffers from prohibitive overhead, a problem that current efficiency methods like pruning and merging address imperfectly, creating a difficult trade-off between compression rate and feature fidelity. To overcome this dilemma, we introduce Prune-then-Merge, a novel two-stage framework that synergizes these complementary approaches. Our method first employs an adaptive pruning stage to filter out low-information patches, creating a refined, high-signal set of embeddings. Subsequently, a hierarchical merging stage compresses this pre-filtered set, effectively summarizing semantic content without the noise-induced feature dilution seen in single-stage methods. Extensive experiments on 29 VDR datasets demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms existing methods, significantly extending the near-lossless compression range and providing robust performance at high compression ratios."}

To overcome this limitation, we reformulate RAG as a cooperative multi-agent decision-making problem and propose Cooperative Retrieval-Augmented Generation (CoRAG), a framework in which the reranker and the generator act as peer decision-makers rather than being connected through an asymmetric dependency pipeline. By jointly optimizing their behaviors toward a shared task objective, the reranker and generator are encouraged to cooperate, ensuring that document reranking and generation work in concert to improve the final response.

Towards the goal of understanding how knowledge is encoded by LLMs, we release NanoKnow, a benchmark dataset that partitions questions from Natural Questions and SQuAD into splits based on whether their answers are present in nanochat's pre-training corpus. Using these splits, we can now properly disentangle the sources of knowledge that LLMs rely on when producing an output. To demonstrate NanoKnow's utility, we conduct experiments using eight nanochat checkpoints. Our findings show: (1) closed-book accuracy is strongly influenced by answer frequency in the pre-training data, (2) providing external evidence can mitigate this frequency dependence, (3) even with external evidence, models are more accurate when answers were seen during pre-training, demonstrating that parametric and external knowledge are complementary, and (4) non-relevant information is harmful, with accuracy decreasing based on both the position and the number of non-relevant contexts.

The pipeline intercepts Whisper's initial transcript, applies specialized LLM agents for domain context identification, named entity recognition, and jargon detection, and generates compact prompts that guide Whisper's decoder. Evaluated on 421 NBA basketball commentary segments (a domain characterized by dense proper nouns and technical terminology) our best pipeline achieves a statistically significant 17.0% relative reduction in word error rate (WER; from 0.217 to 0.180, p<0.001).

Lee"], "title": "Capable but Unreliable: Canonical Path Deviation as a Causal Mechanism of Agent Failure in Long-Horizon Tasks", "comment": null, "summary": "Why do language agents fail on tasks they are capable of solving? We argue that many such failures are reliability failures caused by stochastic drift from a task's latent solution structure, not capability failures. Every well-defined tool-use task imposes a canonical solution path (i.e., a convergent set of tool invocations shared across successful runs) and agent success depends critically on whether a trajectory stays within this path's operating envelope. We establish this causally using a natural experiment that holds model capability and task difficulty fixed by construction. We analyze trajectories from the Toolathlon benchmark: 22 frontier models each attempt 108 real-world tool-use tasks across 3 independent runs, yielding 515 model$\\times$task units where the same model succeeds on some runs and fails on others due to LLM sampling stochasticity alone. Within these units, successful runs adhere significantly more closely to the canonical solution path than failed runs ($+$0.060 Jaccard, $p<0.0001$, $n=488$ units, 95% CI [+0.043, +0.077]). This result survives six robustness checks including cross-model-family leave-one-out validation. Critically, the causal mechanism is gradual and self-reinforcing: the adherence gap is statistically indistinguishable from zero through the first 50% of the trajectory, ruling out early-branching selection bias, and each off-canonical tool call raises the probability that the next call is also off-canonical by 22.7 percentage points ($\\hatβ=+0.227$, $p<0.0001$), more than doubling the baseline rate. These findings imply that agent reliability cannot be improved by capability scaling alone, but offer a highly actionable intervention: a simple monitor that restarts the bottom tercile of runs based on mid-trajectory canonical adherence lifts success rates by $+$8.8 percentage points among intervened runs."}

In this work, we revisit the fundamental next-token prediction (NTP) as a candidate paradigm for unstructured editing. We identify Context Reliance as a critical failure mode of NTP-based approaches, where knowledge acquired from edited text becomes highly dependent on its preceding context, leading to recall failures when that context is absent during inference. This hypothesis is supported by our empirical validation that prepending context during inference recovers knowledge recall. We further theoretically demonstrate that Context Reliance is an inherent consequence of gradient-based optimization, which tends to bind acquired knowledge to a specific aggregated contextual representation. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective COntext-INdependent editing framework (COIN), encouraging model to focus on knowledge within local scope rather than memorizing contextual patterns. Evaluations show that COIN reduces Context Reliance by 45.2% and outperforms strong baselines by 23.6% in editing success rate, highlighting the vital role of mitigating Context Reliance for robust editing."}

Motivated by their shared transformer architectures, we investigate whether the two model families rely on common internal computation for such inference. At the neuron level, we uncover a surprisingly large overlap: more than half of the top-activated units during multi-step inference are shared between representative LLMs and LVLMs, revealing a modality-invariant inference subspace.\n  Through causal probing via activation amplification, we further show that these shared neurons encode consistent and interpretable concept-level effects, demonstrating their functional contribution to inference. Building on this insight, we propose Shared Neuron Low-Rank Fusion (SNRF), a parameter-efficient framework that transfers mature inference circuitry from LLMs to LVLMs. SNRF profiles cross-model activations to identify shared neurons, computes a low-rank approximation of inter-model weight differences, and injects these updates selectively within the shared-neuron subspace. This mechanism strengthens multimodal inference performance with minimal parameter changes and requires no large-scale multimodal fine-tuning.\n  Across diverse mathematics and perception benchmarks, SNRF consistently enhances LVLM inference performance while preserving perceptual capabilities. Our results demonstrate that shared neurons form an interpretable bridge between LLMs and LVLMs, enabling low-cost transfer of inference ability into multimodal models.

Although some studies have shown that LLMs can, to a certain extent, evaluate research according to perceived quality, our understanding of the internal mechanisms that enable this capability remains limited. This paper presents the first study that investigates how LLMs encode the concept of scientific quality through relevant monosemantic features extracted using sparse autoencoders. We derive such features under different experimental settings and assess their ability to serve as predictors across three tasks related to research quality: predicting citation count, journal SJR, and journal h-index. The results indicate that LLMs encode features associated with multiple dimensions of scientific quality. In particular, we identify four recurring types of features that capture key aspects of how research quality is represented: 1) features reflecting research methodologies; 2) features related to publication type, with literature reviews typically exhibiting higher impact; 3) features associated with high-impact research fields and technologies; and 4) features corresponding to specific scientific jargons. These findings represent an important step toward understanding how LLMs encapsulate concepts related to research quality."}

Multi-hop reasoning, which requires models to engage in deliberate thinking and multi-step interaction, serves as a critical testbed for assessing such capabilities. However, existing benchmarks typically provide only final questions and answers, while lacking the intermediate hop-level questions that gradually connect atomic questions to the final multi-hop query. This limitation prevents researchers from analyzing at which step an agent fails and restricts more fine-grained evaluation of model capabilities. Moreover, most current benchmarks are manually constructed, which is both time-consuming and labor-intensive, while also limiting scalability and generalization. To address these challenges, we introduce AgenticRAGTracer, the first Agentic RAG benchmark that is primarily constructed automatically by large language models and designed to support step-by-step validation. Our benchmark spans multiple domains, contains 1,305 data points, and has no overlap with existing mainstream benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that even the best large language models perform poorly on our dataset. For instance, GPT-5 attains merely 22.6\\% EM accuracy on the hardest portion of our dataset. Hop-aware diagnosis reveals that failures are primarily driven by distorted reasoning chains -- either collapsing prematurely or wandering into over-extension. This highlights a critical inability to allocate steps consistent with the task's logical structure, providing a diagnostic dimension missing in traditional evaluations. We believe our work will facilitate research in Agentic RAG and inspire further meaningful progress in this area. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/YqjMartin/AgenticRAGTracer."}

In contrast, prompt- and RAG-based signals are easy to apply but can be diluted in long dialogues, leading to drifting and sometimes inconsistent persona behavior. To address this, we propose a contrastive Sparse AutoEncoder (SAE) framework that learns facet-level personality control vectors aligned with the Big Five 30-facet model. A new 15,000-sample leakage-controlled corpus is constructed to provide balanced supervision for each facet. The learned vectors are integrated into the model's residual space and dynamically selected by a trait-activated routing module, enabling precise and interpretable personality steering. Experiments on Large Language Models (LLMs) show that the proposed method maintains stable character fidelity and output quality across contextualized settings, outperforming Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and prompt-only baselines. The combined SAE+Prompt configuration achieves the best overall performance, confirming that contrastively trained latent vectors can enhance persona control while preserving dialogue coherence."}

Prompt, Reward, and Policy Optimization in Search-R1", "comment": null, "summary": "Deep Research agents tackle knowledge-intensive tasks through multi-round retrieval and decision-oriented generation. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been shown to improve performance in this paradigm, its contributions remain underexplored. To fully understand the role of RL, we conduct a systematic study along three decoupled dimensions: prompt template, reward function, and policy optimization. Our study reveals that: 1) the Fast Thinking template yields greater stability and better performance than the Slow Thinking template used in prior work; 2) the F1-based reward underperforms the EM due to training collapse driven by answer avoidance; this can be mitigated by incorporating action-level penalties, ultimately surpassing EM; 3) REINFORCE outperforms PPO while requiring fewer search actions, whereas GRPO shows the poorest stability among policy optimization methods. Building on these insights, we then introduce Search-R1++, a strong baseline that improves the performance of Search-R1 from 0.403 to 0.442 (Qwen2.5-7B) and 0.289 to 0.331 (Qwen2.5-3B). We hope that our findings can pave the way for more principled and reliable RL training strategies in Deep Research systems."}

However, constructing high-quality hypergraphs remains challenging due to the \\textit{scenario gap}: generic extractors struggle to generalize across diverse domains with specific jargon, while existing methods often fail to balance structural skeletons with fine-grained details. To bridge this gap, we propose \\textbf{Hyper-KGGen}, a skill-driven framework that reformulates extraction as a dynamic skill-evolving process. First, Hyper-KGGen employs a \\textit{coarse-to-fine} mechanism to systematically decompose documents, ensuring full-dimensional coverage from binary links to complex hyperedges. Crucially, it incorporates an \\textit{adaptive skill acquisition} module that actively distills domain expertise into a Global Skill Library. This is achieved via a stability-based feedback loop, where extraction stability serves as a relative reward signal to induce high-quality skills from unstable traces and missed predictions. Additionally, we present \\textbf{HyperDocRED}, a rigorously annotated benchmark for document-level knowledge hypergraph extraction. Experiments demonstrate that Hyper-KGGen significantly outperforms strong baselines, validating that evolved skills provide substantially richer guidance than static few-shot examples in multi-scenario settings."}

We first show that while different extractors may lead to similar model performance on standard language understanding tasks, the pages surviving a fixed filtering pipeline can differ substantially. This suggests a simple intervention: by taking a Union over different extractors, we can increase the token yield of DCLM-Baseline by up to 71% while maintaining benchmark performance. We further show that for structured content such as tables and code blocks, extractor choice can significantly impact downstream task performance, with differences of up to 10 percentage points (p.p.) on WikiTQ and 3 p.p. on HumanEval."}

The state-of-the-art multi-vector paradigm excels in performance but suffers from prohibitive overhead, a problem that current efficiency methods like pruning and merging address imperfectly, creating a difficult trade-off between compression rate and feature fidelity. To overcome this dilemma, we introduce Prune-then-Merge, a novel two-stage framework that synergizes these complementary approaches. Our method first employs an adaptive pruning stage to filter out low-information patches, creating a refined, high-signal set of embeddings. Subsequently, a hierarchical merging stage compresses this pre-filtered set, effectively summarizing semantic content without the noise-induced feature dilution seen in single-stage methods. Extensive experiments on 29 VDR datasets demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms existing methods, significantly extending the near-lossless compression range and providing robust performance at high compression ratios."}

To address this, we introduce the Style-Adaptive Multi-Agent System (SAMAS), a novel framework that treats style preservation as a signal processing task. Specifically, our method quantifies literary style into a Stylistic Feature Spectrum (SFS) using the wavelet packet transform. This SFS serves as a control signal to dynamically assemble a tailored workflow of specialized translation agents based on the source text's structural patterns. Extensive experiments on translation benchmarks show that SAMAS achieves competitive semantic accuracy against strong baselines, primarily by leveraging its statistically significant advantage in style fidelity."}

SHIELD combines disproportionality analysis with semantic clustering of adverse event (AE) terms applied to MedDRA term embeddings. For each AE, the pipeline computes an information-theoretic disproportionality measure (Information Component) with effect size derived via empirical Bayesian shrinkage. A utility matrix is constructed by weighting semantic term-term similarities by signal magnitude, followed by spectral embedding and clustering to identify groups of related AEs. Resulting clusters are annotated with syndrome-level summary labels using large language models, yielding a coherent, data-driven representation of treatment-associated safety profiles in the form of a network graph and hierarchical tree. We implement the SHIELD framework in the context of a single-arm incidence summary, to compare two treatment arms or for the detection of any treatment effect in a multi-arm trial. We illustrate its ability to recover known safety signals and generate interpretable, cluster-based summaries in a real clinical trial example. This work bridges statistical signal detection with modern natural language processing to enhance safety assessment and causal interpretation in clinical trials."}

Five of ODRL's approximately 34 left operands, however, denote multi-dimensional quantities--image dimensions, canvas positions, geographic coordinates--whose specification text explicitly references multiple axes. For these operands, a single scalar constraint admits one interpretation per axis, making policy evaluation non-deterministic.\n  We classify ODRL's left operands by value-domain structure (scalar, dimensional, concept-valued), grounded in the ODRL 2.2 specification text, and show that dimensional ambiguity is intrinsic to the constraint syntax.\n  We present an axis-decomposition framework that refines each dimensional operand into axis-specific scalar operands and prove four properties: deterministic interpretation, AABB completeness, sound over-approximation under projection, and conservative extension.\n  Conflict detection operates in two layers: per-axis verdicts are always decidable; box-level verdicts compose through Strong Kleene conjunction into a three-valued logic (Conflict, Compatible, Unknown). For ODRL's disjunctive (odrl:or) and exclusive-or (odrl:xone) logical constraints, where per-axis decomposition does not apply, the framework encodes coupled multi-axis conjectures directly.\n  We instantiate the framework as the ODRL Spatial Axis Profile--15 axis-specific left operands for the five affected base terms--and evaluate it on 117 benchmark problems spanning nine categories across both TPTP FOF (Vampire) and SMT-LIB (Z3) encodings, achieving full concordance between provers.

Without it, every cross-dataspace policy comparison defaults to Unknown. We present a denotational semantics that maps each ODRL constraint to the set of knowledge-base concepts satisfying it. Conflict detection reduces to denotation intersection under a three-valued verdict -- Conflict, Compatible, or Unknown -- that is sound under incomplete knowledge. The framework covers all three ODRL composition modes (and, or, xone) and all three semantic domains arising in practice: taxonomic (class subsumption), mereological (part-whole containment), and nominal (identity). For cross-dataspace interoperability, we define order-preserving alignments between knowledge bases and prove two guarantees: conflicts are preserved across different KB standards, and unmapped concepts degrade gracefully to Unknown -- never to false conflicts. A runtime soundness theorem ensures that design-time verdicts hold for all execution contexts. The encoding stays within the decidable EPR fragment of first-order logic. We validate it with 154 benchmarks across six knowledge base families (GeoNames, ISO 3166, W3C DPV, a GDPR-derived taxonomy, BCP 47, and ISO 639-3) and four structural KBs targeting adversarial edge cases. Both the Vampire theorem prover and the Z3 SMT solver agree on all 154 verdicts. A key finding is that exclusive composition (xone) requires strictly stronger KB axioms than conjunction or disjunction: open-world semantics blocks exclusivity even when positive evidence appears to satisfy exactly one branch."}

These limitations have motivated growing interest in using textual information as the primary source of trading signals in learning-based systems. Two key challenges hinder existing approaches: (1) the absence of large-scale, event-centric datasets that jointly model news semantics and statistically grounded market reactions, and (2) the misalignment between language model reasoning and financially valid trading behavior under dynamic market conditions. To address these challenges, we propose Janus-Q, an end-to-end event-driven trading framework that elevates financial news events from auxiliary signals to primary decision units. Janus-Q unifies event-centric data construction and model optimization under a two-stage paradigm. Stage I focuses on event-centric data construction, building a large-scale financial news event dataset comprising 62,400 articles annotated with 10 fine-grained event types, associated stocks, sentiment labels, and event-driven cumulative abnormal return (CAR). Stage II performs decision-oriented fine-tuning, combining supervised learning with reinforcement learning guided by a Hierarchical Gated Reward Model (HGRM), which explicitly captures trade-offs among multiple trading objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Janus-Q achieves more consistent, interpretable, and profitable trading decisions than market indices and LLM baselines, improving the Sharpe Ratio by up to 102.0% while increasing direction accuracy by over 17.5% compared to the strongest competing strategies."}

Attention-based re-ranking methods, which derive relevance scores directly from attention weights, offer an efficient and interpretable alternative to generation-based re-ranking methods. However, they still face two major limitations. First, attention signals are highly concentrated a small subset of tokens within a few documents, making others indistinguishable. Second, attention often overemphasizes phrases lexically similar to the query, yielding biased rankings that irrelevant documents with mere lexical resemblance are regarded as relevant. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{ReAttn}, a post-hoc re-weighting strategy for attention-based re-ranking methods. It first compute the cross-document IDF weighting to down-weight attention on query-overlapping tokens that frequently appear across the candidate documents, reducing lexical bias and emphasizing distinctive terms. It then employs entropy-based regularization to mitigate over-concentrated attention, encouraging a more balanced distribution across informative tokens.

Experiments on four benchmarks, WikiTQ, HiTab, NQ-Table, and SequentialQA show consistent gains across models and reasoning paradigms, with particularly strong improvements on a challenge set of structurally diverse, unseen questions."}

Although effective, this approach fails to leverage textual information in questions and responses, especially for open-ended questions. In this work, we propose GENCAT (\\textbf{GEN}erative \\textbf{CAT}), a novel CAT framework that leverages Large Language Models for knowledge estimate and question selection. First, we develop a Generative Item Response Theory (GIRT) model that enables us to estimate student knowledge from their open-ended responses and predict responses to unseen questions. We train the model in a two-step process, first via Supervised Fine-Tuning and then via preference optimization for knowledge-response alignment. Second, we introduce three question selection algorithms that leverage the generative capabilities of the GIRT model, based on the uncertainty, linguistic diversity, and information of sampled student responses. Third, we conduct experiments on two real-world programming datasets and demonstrate that GENCAT outperforms existing CAT baselines, achieving an AUC improvement of up to 4.32\\% in the key early testing stages."}

We present AgenticSum, an inference-time, agentic framework that separates context selection, generation, verification, and targeted correction to reduce hallucinated content. The framework decomposes summarization into coordinated stages that compress task-relevant context, generate an initial draft, identify weakly supported spans using internal attention grounding signals, and selectively revise flagged content under supervisory control. We evaluate AgenticSum on two public datasets, using reference-based metrics, LLM-as-a-judge assessment, and human evaluation. Across various measures, AgenticSum demonstrates consistent improvements compared to vanilla LLMs and other strong baselines. Our results indicate that structured, agentic design with targeted correction offers an effective inference time solution to improve clinical note summarization using LLMs."}

We take the position that the dominant paradigm of General Alignment, which compresses diverse human values into a single scalar reward, reaches a structural ceiling in settings with conflicting values, plural stakeholders, and irreducible uncertainty. These failures follow from the mathematics and incentives of scalarization and lead to \\textbf{structural} value flattening, \\textbf{normative} representation loss, and \\textbf{cognitive} uncertainty blindness. We introduce Edge Alignment as a distinct approach in which systems preserve multi dimensional value structure, support plural and democratic representation, and incorporate epistemic mechanisms for interaction and clarification. To make this approach practical, we propose seven interdependent pillars organized into three phases. We identify key challenges in data collection, training objectives, and evaluation, outlining complementary technical and governance directions. Taken together, these measures reframe alignment as a lifecycle problem of dynamic normative governance rather than as a single instance optimization task."}

Given the probabilistic nature of modern LLMs, we assume a probabilistic model for these LLMs, following a constant random distribution and the source itself thus being stationary. We compare this source entropy (per word) to that of natural language (written or spoken) as represented by the Open American National Corpus (OANC). Our results indicate that the word entropy of such LLMs is lower than the word entropy of natural speech both in written or spoken form. The long-term goal of such studies is to formalize the intuitions of information and uncertainty in large language training to assess the impact of training an LLM from LLM generated training data. This refers to texts from the world wide web in particular."}

While their core use relies on comprehending written requests, our understanding of this ability is currently limited, because most benchmarks evaluate LLMs in high-resource languages predominantly spoken by Western, Educated, Industrialised, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) communities. The default assumption is that English is the best-performing language for LLMs, while smaller, low-resource languages are linked to less reliable outputs, even in multilingual, state-of-the-art models. To track variation in the comprehension abilities of LLMs, we prompt 3 popular models on a language comprehension task across 12 languages, representing the Indo-European, Afro-Asiatic, Turkic, Sino-Tibetan, and Japonic language families. Our results suggest that the models exhibit remarkable linguistic accuracy across typologically diverse languages, yet they fall behind human baselines in all of them, albeit to different degrees. Contrary to what was expected, English is not the best-performing language, as it was systematically outperformed by several Romance languages, even lower-resource ones. We frame the results by discussing the role of several factors that drive LLM performance, such as tokenization, language distance from Spanish and English, size of training data, and data origin in high- vs. low-resource languages and WEIRD vs. non-WEIRD communities."}

In realistic retrieval settings, the retrieved document set often contains a mixture of documents that vary in relevance and usefulness. While prior work has largely examined these phenomena through output behavior, little is known about how retrieved context shapes the internal representations that mediate information integration in RAG. In this work, we study RAG through the lens of latent representations. We systematically analyze how different types of retrieved documents affect the hidden states of LLMs, and how these internal representation shifts relate to downstream generation behavior. Across four question-answering datasets and three LLMs, we analyze internal representations under controlled single- and multi-document settings. Our results reveal how context relevancy and layer-wise processing influence internal representations, providing explanations on LLMs output behaviors and insights for RAG system design."}

Answering this question has been difficult because pre-training data is often a \"black box\" -- unknown or inaccessible. The recent release of nanochat -- a family of small LLMs with fully open pre-training data -- addresses this as it provides a transparent view into where a model's parametric knowledge comes from. Towards the goal of understanding how knowledge is encoded by LLMs, we release NanoKnow, a benchmark dataset that partitions questions from Natural Questions and SQuAD into splits based on whether their answers are present in nanochat's pre-training corpus. Using these splits, we can now properly disentangle the sources of knowledge that LLMs rely on when producing an output. To demonstrate NanoKnow's utility, we conduct experiments using eight nanochat checkpoints. Our findings show: (1) closed-book accuracy is strongly influenced by answer frequency in the pre-training data, (2) providing external evidence can mitigate this frequency dependence, (3) even with external evidence, models are more accurate when answers were seen during pre-training, demonstrating that parametric and external knowledge are complementary, and (4) non-relevant information is harmful, with accuracy decreasing based on both the position and the number of non-relevant contexts. We release all NanoKnow artifacts at https://github.com/castorini/NanoKnow."}

Two open-source LLMs (Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B) were evaluated on four biomedical QA benchmarks-HeadQA, MedQA-USMLE, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA.

Yet evaluating these systems remains bottlenecked by the time and cost of building specialized assessment datasets. We introduce KNIGHT, an LLM-based, knowledge-graph-driven framework for generating multiple-choice question (MCQ) datasets from external sources. KNIGHT constructs a topic-specific knowledge graph, a structured and parsimonious summary of entities and relations, that can be reused to generate instructor-controlled difficulty levels, including multi-hop questions, without repeatedly re-feeding the full source text. This knowledge graph acts as a compressed, reusable state, making question generation a cheap read over the graph. We instantiate KNIGHT on Wikipedia/Wikidata while keeping the framework domain- and ontology-agnostic. As a case study, KNIGHT produces six MCQ datasets in History, Biology, and Mathematics. We evaluate quality on five criteria: fluency, unambiguity (single correct answer), topic relevance, option uniqueness, and answerability given the provided sources (as a proxy for hallucination). Results show that KNIGHT enables token- and cost-efficient generation from a reusable graph representation, achieves high quality across these criteria, and yields model rankings aligned with MMLU-style benchmarks, while supporting topic-specific and difficulty-controlled evaluation."}
