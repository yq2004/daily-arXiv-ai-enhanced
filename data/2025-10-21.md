Abstract: Quantum natural language processing (QNLP) offers a novel approach to
semantic modeling by embedding compositional structure directly into quantum
circuits. This paper investigates the application of QNLP models to the task of
Natural Language Inference (NLI), comparing quantum, hybrid, and classical
transformer-based models under a constrained few-shot setting. Using the lambeq
library and the DisCoCat framework, we construct parameterized quantum circuits
for sentence pairs and train them for both semantic relatedness and inference
classification. To assess efficiency, we introduce a novel
information-theoretic metric, Information Gain per Parameter (IGPP), which
quantifies learning dynamics independent of model size. Our results demonstrate
that quantum models achieve performance comparable to classical baselines while
operating with dramatically fewer parameters. The Quantum-based models
outperform randomly initialized transformers in inference and achieve lower
test error on relatedness tasks. Moreover, quantum models exhibit significantly
higher per-parameter learning efficiency (up to five orders of magnitude more
than classical counterparts), highlighting the promise of QNLP in low-resource,
structure-sensitive settings. To address circuit-level isolation and promote
parameter sharing, we also propose a novel cluster-based architecture that
improves generalization by tying gate parameters to learned word clusters
rather than individual tokens.

Abstract: This study presents a novel multi-model fusion framework leveraging two
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), ChatGPT and Claude, to enhance
the reliability of chest X-ray interpretation on the CheXpert dataset. From the
full CheXpert corpus of 224,316 chest radiographs, we randomly selected 234
radiologist-annotated studies to evaluate unimodal performance using image-only
prompts. In this setting, ChatGPT and Claude achieved diagnostic accuracies of
62.8% and 76.9%, respectively. A similarity-based consensus approach, using a
95% output similarity threshold, improved accuracy to 77.6%. To assess the
impact of multimodal inputs, we then generated synthetic clinical notes
following the MIMIC-CXR template and evaluated a separate subset of 50 randomly
selected cases paired with both images and synthetic text. On this multimodal
cohort, performance improved to 84% for ChatGPT and 76% for Claude, while
consensus accuracy reached 91.3%. Across both experimental conditions,
agreement-based fusion consistently outperformed individual models. These
findings highlight the utility of integrating complementary modalities and
using output-level consensus to improve the trustworthiness and clinical
utility of AI-assisted radiological diagnosis, offering a practical path to
reduce diagnostic errors with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Self-correction of large language models (LLMs) emerges as a critical
component for enhancing their reasoning performance. Although various
self-correction methods have been proposed, a comprehensive evaluation of these
methods remains largely unexplored, and the question of whether LLMs can truly
correct themselves is a matter of significant interest and concern. In this
study, we introduce CorrectBench, a benchmark developed to evaluate the
effectiveness of self-correction strategies, including intrinsic, external, and
fine-tuned approaches, across three tasks: commonsense reasoning, mathematical
reasoning, and code generation. Our findings reveal that: 1) Self-correction
methods can improve accuracy, especially for complex reasoning tasks; 2) Mixing
different self-correction strategies yields further improvements, though it
reduces efficiency; 3) Reasoning LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) have limited
optimization under additional self-correction methods and have high time costs.
Interestingly, a comparatively simple chain-of-thought (CoT) baseline
demonstrates competitive accuracy and efficiency. These results underscore the
potential of self-correction to enhance LLM's reasoning performance while
highlighting the ongoing challenge of improving their efficiency. Consequently,
we advocate for further research focused on optimizing the balance between
reasoning capabilities and operational efficiency. Project Page:

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Current Large Language Model (LLM) agents show strong performance in tool
use, but lack the crucial capability to systematically learn from their own
experiences. While existing frameworks mainly focus on mitigating external
knowledge gaps, they fail to address a more fundamental limitation: the
inability to iteratively refine problem-solving strategies. In this work, we
introduce EvolveR, a framework designed to enable agent to self-improve through
a complete, closed-loop experience lifecycle. This lifecycle comprises two key
stages: (1) Offline Self-Distillation, where the agent's interaction
trajectories are synthesized into a structured repository of abstract, reusable
strategic principles; (2) Online Interaction, where the agent interacts with
tasks and actively retrieves distilled principles to guide its decision-making,
accumulating a diverse set of behavioral trajectories. This loop employs a
policy reinforcement mechanism to iteratively update the agent based on its
performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EvolveR on complex multi-hop
question-answering benchmarks, where it achieves superior performance over
strong agentic baselines. Our work presents a comprehensive blueprint for
agents that learn not only from external data but also from the consequences of
their own actions, paving the way for more autonomous and continuously
improving systems. Code is available at https://github.com/Edaizi/EvolveR.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This study quantifies how prompting strategies interact with large language
models (LLMs) to automate the screening stage of systematic literature reviews
(SLRs). We evaluate six LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-Chat-V3,
Gemini-2.5-Flash, Claude-3.5-Haiku, Llama-4-Maverick) under five prompt types
(zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), CoT-few-shot, self-reflection)
across relevance classification and six Level-2 tasks, using accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1. Results show pronounced model-prompt interaction
effects: CoT-few-shot yields the most reliable precision-recall balance;
zero-shot maximizes recall for high-sensitivity passes; and self-reflection
underperforms due to over-inclusivity and instability across models. GPT-4o and
DeepSeek provide robust overall performance, while GPT-4o-mini performs
competitively at a substantially lower dollar cost. A cost-performance analysis
for relevance classification (per 1,000 abstracts) reveals large absolute
differences among model-prompt pairings; GPT-4o-mini remains low-cost across
prompts, and structured prompts (CoT/CoT-few-shot) on GPT-4o-mini offer
attractive F1 at a small incremental cost. We recommend a staged workflow that
(1) deploys low-cost models with structured prompts for first-pass screening
and (2) escalates only borderline cases to higher-capacity models. These
findings highlight LLMs' uneven but promising potential to automate literature
screening. By systematically analyzing prompt-model interactions, we provide a
comparative benchmark and practical guidance for task-adaptive LLM deployment.

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Language models are pretrained on sequences that blend statistical
regularities (making text fluent) with factual associations between specific
tokens (knowledge of facts). While recent work suggests that the variability of
their interaction, such as paraphrases of factual associations, critically
determines generalization ability, we lack a systematic analysis of these
impacts. This paper introduces a flexible synthetic testbed that combines a
statistical stream of generic tokens with an abstract factual stream of
source-target token pairs, enabling fine-grained control over their
interaction. The design enables the independent control of diversity nature by
manipulating stream composition (contextual structure) and the diversity level
by varying which statistical streams each fact appears in. Through controlled
experiments, we find that while higher contextual diversity delays
in-distribution (ID) factual accuracy, its impact on out-of-distribution (OOD)
factual generalization depends critically on contextual structure. In some
cases, OOD performance follows the same trend as ID, but in others, diversity
becomes essential for non-trivial factual recall. Even when low diversity
prohibits factual recall, optimal diversity levels depend on training duration.
Beyond factual recall failures, we identify structures where statistical
generalization fails independently, and others where both capabilities degrade.
This shows how the interplay between contextual design and diversity level
impacts different generalization aspects. Further, through a series of
controlled interventions on the model components, we trace the OOD failures to
distinct optimization bottlenecks, highlighting the importance of the embedding
and unembedding layers. Our synthetic framework allows us to isolate effects
that would be confounded in large-scale studies, offering a controlled testbed
for future investigations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The rise of generative AI (GenAI) has impacted many aspects of human life. As
these systems become embedded in everyday practices, understanding public trust
in them also becomes essential for responsible adoption and governance. Prior
work on trust in AI has largely drawn from psychology and human-computer
interaction, but there is a lack of computational, large-scale, and
longitudinal approaches to measuring trust and distrust in GenAI and large
language models (LLMs). This paper presents the first computational study of
Trust and Distrust in GenAI, using a multi-year Reddit dataset (2022--2025)
spanning 39 subreddits and 197,618 posts. Crowd-sourced annotations of a
representative sample were combined with classification models to scale
analysis. We find that Trust and Distrust are nearly balanced over time, with
shifts around major model releases. Technical performance and usability
dominate as dimensions, while personal experience is the most frequent reason
shaping attitudes. Distinct patterns also emerge across trustors (e.g.,
experts, ethicists, general users). Our results provide a methodological
framework for large-scale Trust analysis and insights into evolving public
perceptions of GenAI.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Despite recent advances in AI, multimodal culturally diverse datasets are
still limited, particularly for regions in the Middle East and Africa. In this
paper, we introduce EgMM-Corpus, a multimodal dataset dedicated to Egyptian
culture. By designing and running a new data collection pipeline, we collected
over 3,000 images, covering 313 concepts across landmarks, food, and folklore.
Each entry in the dataset is manually validated for cultural authenticity and
multimodal coherence. EgMM-Corpus aims to provide a reliable resource for
evaluating and training vision-language models in an Egyptian cultural context.
We further evaluate the zero-shot performance of Contrastive Language-Image
Pre-training CLIP on EgMM-Corpus, on which it achieves 21.2% Top-1 accuracy and
36.4% Top-5 accuracy in classification. These results underscore the existing
cultural bias in large-scale vision-language models and demonstrate the
importance of EgMM-Corpus as a benchmark for developing culturally aware
models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: What have language models (LMs) learned about grammar? This question remains
hotly debated, with major ramifications for linguistic theory. However, since
probability and grammaticality are distinct notions in linguistics, it is not
obvious what string probabilities can reveal about an LM's underlying
grammatical knowledge. We present a theoretical analysis of the relationship
between grammar, meaning, and string probability, based on simple assumptions
about the generative process of corpus data. Our framework makes three
predictions, which we validate empirically using 280K sentence pairs in English
and Chinese: (1) correlation between the probability of strings within minimal
pairs, i.e., string pairs with minimal semantic differences; (2) correlation
between models' and humans' deltas within minimal pairs; and (3) poor
separation in probability space between unpaired grammatical and ungrammatical
strings. Our analyses give theoretical grounding for using probability to learn
about LMs' structural knowledge, and suggest directions for future work in LM
grammatical evaluation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As language models have a greater impact on society, it is important to
ensure they are aligned to a diverse range of perspectives and are able to
reflect nuance in human values. However, the most popular training paradigms
for modern language models often assume there is one optimal answer for every
query, leading to generic responses and poor alignment. In this work, we aim to
enhance pluralistic alignment of language models in a low-resource setting with
two methods: pluralistic decoding and model steering. We empirically
demonstrate that model steering offers consistent improvement over zero-shot
and few-shot baselines with only 50 annotated samples. Our proposed methods
decrease false positives in several high-stakes tasks such as hate speech
detection and misinformation detection, and improves the distributional
alignment to human values in GlobalOpinionQA. We hope our work highlights the
importance of diversity and how language models can be adapted to consider
nuanced perspectives.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Personalized large language models (LLMs) tailor content to individual
preferences using user profiles or histories. However, existing
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as the
``One-PEFT-Per-User'' (OPPU) paradigm, require training a separate adapter for
each user, making them computationally expensive and impractical for real-time
updates. We introduce Profile-to-PEFT, a scalable framework that employs a
hypernetwork, trained end-to-end, to map a user's encoded profile directly to a
full set of adapter parameters (e.g., LoRA), eliminating per-user training at
deployment. This design enables instant adaptation, generalization to unseen
users, and privacy-preserving local deployment. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms both prompt-based personalization and
OPPU while using substantially fewer computational resources at deployment. The
framework exhibits strong generalization to out-of-distribution users and
maintains robustness across varying user activity levels and different
embedding backbones. The proposed Profile-to-PEFT framework enables efficient,
scalable, and adaptive LLM personalization suitable for large-scale
applications.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent advances in post-training techniques have endowed Large Language
Models (LLMs) with enhanced capabilities for tackling complex, logic-intensive
tasks through the generation of supplementary planning tokens. This development
raises a fundamental question: Are these models aware of what they "learn" and
"think"? To address this, we define three core competencies: (1) awareness of
learned latent policies, (2) generalization of these policies across domains,
and (3) alignment between internal reasoning traces and final outputs. We
empirically evaluate these abilities on several tasks, each designed to require
learning a distinct policy. Furthermore, we contrast the profiles of models
post-trained via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Policy Optimization
(DPO), and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our findings indicate
that RL-trained models not only demonstrate greater awareness of their learned
behaviors and stronger generalizability to novel, structurally similar tasks
than SFT models but also often exhibit weak alignment between their reasoning
traces and final outputs, an effect most pronounced in GRPO-trained models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In an era where public health is increasingly influenced by information
shared on social media, combatting vaccine skepticism and misinformation has
become a critical societal goal. Misleading narratives around vaccination have
spread widely, creating barriers to achieving high immunisation rates and
undermining trust in health recommendations. While efforts to detect
misinformation have made significant progress, the generation of real time
counter-arguments tailored to debunk such claims remains an insufficiently
explored area. In this work, we explore the capabilities of LLMs to generate
sound counter-argument rebuttals to vaccine misinformation. Building on prior
research in misinformation debunking, we experiment with various prompting
strategies and fine-tuning approaches to optimise counter-argument generation.
Additionally, we train classifiers to categorise anti-vaccine tweets into
multi-labeled categories such as concerns about vaccine efficacy, side effects,
and political influences allowing for more context aware rebuttals. Our
evaluation, conducted through human judgment, LLM based assessments, and
automatic metrics, reveals strong alignment across these methods. Our findings
demonstrate that integrating label descriptions and structured fine-tuning
enhances counter-argument effectiveness, offering a promising approach for
mitigating vaccine misinformation at scale.

Abstract: Argument Mining (AM) helps in automating the extraction of complex
argumentative structures such as Argument Components (ACs) like Premise, Claim
etc. and Argumentative Relations (ARs) like Support, Attack etc. in an
argumentative text. Due to the inherent complexity of reasoning involved with
this task, modelling dependencies between ACs and ARs is challenging. Most of
the recent approaches formulate this task through a generative paradigm by
flattening the argumentative structures. In contrast to that, this study
jointly formulates the key tasks of AM in an end-to-end fashion using
Autoregressive Argumentative Structure Prediction (AASP) framework. The
proposed AASP framework is based on the autoregressive structure prediction
framework that has given good performance for several NLP tasks. AASP framework
models the argumentative structures as constrained pre-defined sets of actions
with the help of a conditional pre-trained language model. These actions build
the argumentative structures step-by-step in an autoregressive manner to
capture the flow of argumentative reasoning in an efficient way. Extensive
experiments conducted on three standard AM benchmarks demonstrate that AASP
achieves state-of-theart (SoTA) results across all AM tasks in two benchmarks
and delivers strong results in one benchmark.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) is transforming AI,
opening new opportunities in sensitive and high-impact areas such as Mental
Health (MH). Yet, despite these advancements, recent evidence reveals that
smaller-scale models still struggle to deliver optimal performance in
domain-specific applications. In this study, we present a cost-efficient yet
powerful approach to improve MH assessment capabilities of an LLM, without
relying on any computationally intensive techniques. Our lightweight method
consists of a linear transformation applied to a specific layer's activations,
leveraging steering vectors to guide the model's output. Remarkably, this
intervention enables the model to achieve improved results across two distinct
tasks: (1) identifying whether a Reddit post is useful for detecting the
presence or absence of depressive symptoms (relevance prediction task), and (2)
completing a standardized psychological screening questionnaire for depression
based on users' Reddit post history (questionnaire completion task). Results
highlight the untapped potential of steering mechanisms as computationally
efficient tools for LLMs' MH domain adaptation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to a surge of
interest in query augmentation for information retrieval (IR). Two main
approaches have emerged. The first prompts LLMs to generate answers or
pseudo-documents that serve as new queries, relying purely on the model's
parametric knowledge or contextual information. The second applies
reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune LLMs for query rewriting, directly
optimizing retrieval metrics. While having respective advantages and
limitations, the two approaches have not been compared under consistent
experimental conditions. In this work, we present the first systematic
comparison of prompting-based and RL-based query augmentation across diverse
benchmarks, including evidence-seeking, ad hoc, and tool retrieval. Our key
finding is that simple, training-free query augmentation often performs on par
with, or even surpasses, more expensive RL-based counterparts, especially when
using powerful LLMs. Motivated by this discovery, we introduce a novel hybrid
method, On-policy Pseudo-document Query Expansion (OPQE), which, instead of
rewriting a query, the LLM policy learns to generate a pseudo-document that
maximizes retrieval performance, thus merging the flexibility and generative
structure of prompting with the targeted optimization of RL. We show OPQE
outperforms both standalone prompting and RL-based rewriting, demonstrating
that a synergistic approach yields the best results. Our implementation is made
available to facilitate reproducibility.

Abstract: As AI systems progress, we rely more on them to make decisions with us and
for us. To ensure that such decisions are aligned with human values, it is
imperative for us to understand not only what decisions they make but also how
they come to those decisions. Reasoning language models, which provide both
final responses and (partially transparent) intermediate thinking traces,
present a timely opportunity to study AI procedural reasoning. Unlike math and
code problems which often have objectively correct answers, moral dilemmas are
an excellent testbed for process-focused evaluation because they allow for
multiple defensible conclusions. To do so, we present MoReBench: 1,000 moral
scenarios, each paired with a set of rubric criteria that experts consider
essential to include (or avoid) when reasoning about the scenarios. MoReBench
contains over 23 thousand criteria including identifying moral considerations,
weighing trade-offs, and giving actionable recommendations to cover cases on AI
advising humans moral decisions as well as making moral decisions autonomously.
Separately, we curate MoReBench-Theory: 150 examples to test whether AI can
reason under five major frameworks in normative ethics. Our results show that
scaling laws and existing benchmarks on math, code, and scientific reasoning
tasks fail to predict models' abilities to perform moral reasoning. Models also
show partiality towards specific moral frameworks (e.g., Benthamite Act
Utilitarianism and Kantian Deontology), which might be side effects of popular
training paradigms. Together, these benchmarks advance process-focused
reasoning evaluation towards safer and more transparent AI.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
enhancing large language models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant documents from an
external corpus. However, existing RAG systems primarily focus on unimodal text
documents, and often fall short in real-world scenarios where both queries and
documents may contain mixed modalities (such as text and images). In this
paper, we address the challenge of Universal Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(URAG), which involves retrieving and reasoning over mixed-modal information to
improve vision-language generation. To this end, we propose Nyx, a unified
mixed-modal to mixed-modal retriever tailored for URAG scenarios. To mitigate
the scarcity of realistic mixed-modal data, we introduce a four-stage automated
pipeline for generation and filtering, leveraging web documents to construct
NyxQA, a dataset comprising diverse mixed-modal question-answer pairs that
better reflect real-world information needs. Building on this high-quality
dataset, we adopt a two-stage training framework for Nyx: we first perform
pre-training on NyxQA along with a variety of open-source retrieval datasets,
followed by supervised fine-tuning using feedback from downstream
vision-language models (VLMs) to align retrieval outputs with generative
preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that Nyx not only performs
competitively on standard text-only RAG benchmarks, but also excels in the more
general and realistic URAG setting, significantly improving generation quality
in vision-language tasks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities, yet
their deployment in high-stakes domains is hindered by inherent limitations in
trustworthiness, including hallucinations, instability, and a lack of
transparency. To address these challenges, we introduce a generic
neuro-symbolic approach, which we call Autonomous Trustworthy Agents (ATA). The
core of our approach lies in decoupling tasks into two distinct phases: Offline
knowledge ingestion and online task processing. During knowledge ingestion, an
LLM translates an informal problem specification into a formal, symbolic
knowledge base. This formal representation is crucial as it can be verified and
refined by human experts, ensuring its correctness and alignment with domain
requirements. In the subsequent task processing phase, each incoming input is
encoded into the same formal language. A symbolic decision engine then utilizes
this encoded input in conjunction with the formal knowledge base to derive a
reliable result. Through an extensive evaluation on a complex reasoning task,
we demonstrate that a concrete implementation of ATA is competitive with
state-of-the-art end-to-end reasoning models in a fully automated setup while
maintaining trustworthiness. Crucially, with a human-verified and corrected
knowledge base, our approach significantly outperforms even larger models,
while exhibiting perfect determinism, enhanced stability against input
perturbations, and inherent immunity to prompt injection attacks. By generating
decisions grounded in symbolic reasoning, ATA offers a practical and
controllable architecture for building the next generation of transparent,
auditable, and reliable autonomous agents.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the untapped potential of Whisper, a
well-established automatic speech recognition (ASR) foundation model, in the
context of L2 spoken language assessment (SLA). Unlike prior studies that
extrinsically analyze transcriptions produced by Whisper, our approach goes a
step further to probe its latent capabilities by extracting acoustic and
linguistic features from hidden representations. With only a lightweight
classifier being trained on top of Whisper's intermediate and final outputs,
our method achieves strong performance on the GEPT picture-description dataset,
outperforming existing cutting-edge baselines, including a multimodal approach.
Furthermore, by incorporating image and text-prompt information as auxiliary
relevance cues, we demonstrate additional performance gains. Finally, we
conduct an in-depth analysis of Whisper's embeddings, which reveals that, even
without task-specific fine-tuning, the model intrinsically encodes both ordinal
proficiency patterns and semantic aspects of speech, highlighting its potential
as a powerful foundation for SLA and other spoken language understanding tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) owe much of their stellar performance to
expansive input contexts, yet such verbosity inflates monetary costs, carbon
footprint, and inference-time latency. Much of this overhead manifests from the
redundant low-utility tokens present in typical prompts, as only a fraction of
tokens typically carries the majority of the semantic weight. We address this
inefficiency by introducing FrugalPrompt, a novel prompt compression framework
for LLMs, which retains only the most semantically significant tokens.
Leveraging two state-of-the-art token attribution methods, GlobEnc and DecompX,
we assign salience scores to every token in an input sequence, rank them to
preserve the top-k% tokens in their original order, and obtain a sparse
frugalized prompt. We evaluate the approach across four NLP tasks: Sentiment
Analysis, Commonsense QA, Summarization, and Mathematical Reasoning, using a
suite of frontier LLMs. For the first three tasks, a 20% prompt reduction
incurs only a marginal loss in task performance, demonstrating that
contemporary LLMs can reconstruct elided context from high-salience cues. In
contrast, performance on mathematical reasoning deteriorates sharply,
reflecting a stronger dependence on complete token continuity. Further analysis
with bottom-k% and random-k% tokens reveals asymmetric performance patterns
that may suggest potential task contamination effects, wherein models may
resort to shallow memorized patterns from pretraining exposure for conventional
NLP tasks. We posit that our work contributes to a more nuanced understanding
of LLM behavior in performance-efficiency trade-offs, and delineate the
boundary between tasks tolerant to contextual sparsity and those requiring
exhaustive context. Our source code and models are available at:

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in complex
reasoning tasks, largely enabled by test-time scaling (TTS) paradigms that
allocate additional compute during inference. Among these, external TTS
(particularly the Best-of-N selection paradigm) yields scalable performance
improvements by selecting from multiple independently generated reasoning
trajectories. However, this approach faces key limitations: (i) the high
computational overhead of deploying process reward models, (ii) the
underutilization of the LLM's intrinsic latent representations. We introduce
TrajSelector, an efficient and effective Best-of-N framework that exploit the
hidden states in the sampler LLM for process-level scoring. A lightweight
verifier (with only 0.6B parameters) evaluates the quality of step-wise
trajectory, and then aggregates these scores to identify the optimal reasoning
trajectory. Our framework employs a fully data-driven, end-to-end training
recipe that eliminates reliance on massive step-level annotations. Experiential
results across five benchmarks demonstrate that TrajSelector delivers
consistent performance gains. In Best-of-32 settings, it surpasses majority
voting by 4.61% accuracy and outperforms existing process reward models by
4.31% to 12.21%, all while maintaining lower inference costs.

Abstract: Advertisement (Ad) video violation detection is critical for ensuring
platform compliance, but existing methods struggle with precise temporal
grounding, noisy annotations, and limited generalization. We propose RAVEN, a
novel framework that integrates curriculum reinforcement learning with
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enhance reasoning and cognitive
capabilities for violation detection. RAVEN employs a progressive training
strategy, combining precisely and coarsely annotated data, and leverages Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to develop emergent reasoning abilities
without explicit reasoning annotations. Multiple hierarchical sophisticated
reward mechanism ensures precise temporal grounding and consistent category
prediction. Experiments on industrial datasets and public benchmarks show that
RAVEN achieves superior performances in violation category accuracy and
temporal interval localization. We also design a pipeline to deploy the RAVEN
on the online Ad services, and online A/B testing further validates its
practical applicability, with significant improvements in precision and recall.
RAVEN also demonstrates strong generalization, mitigating the catastrophic
forgetting issue associated with supervised fine-tuning.

Abstract: Natural Language Inference datasets often exhibit human label variation. To
better understand these variations, explanation-based approaches analyze the
underlying reasoning behind annotators' decisions. One such approach is the
LiTEx taxonomy, which categorizes free-text explanations in English into
reasoning types. However, previous work applying such taxonomies has focused on
within-label variation: cases where annotators agree on the final NLI label but
provide different explanations. In contrast, this paper broadens the scope by
examining how annotators may diverge not only in the reasoning type but also in
the labeling step. We use explanations as a lens to decompose the reasoning
process underlying NLI annotation and to analyze individual differences. We
apply LiTEx to two NLI English datasets and align annotation variation from
multiple aspects: NLI label agreement, explanation similarity, and taxonomy
agreement, with an additional compounding factor of annotators' selection bias.
We observe instances where annotators disagree on the label but provide highly
similar explanations, suggesting that surface-level disagreement may mask
underlying agreement in interpretation. Moreover, our analysis reveals
individual preferences in explanation strategies and label choices. These
findings highlight that agreement in reasoning types better reflects the
semantic similarity of free-text explanations than label agreement alone. Our
findings underscore the richness of reasoning-based explanations and the need
for caution in treating labels as ground truth.

Abstract: As Large Language Model (LLM) agents increasingly operate in complex
environments with real-world consequences, their safety becomes critical. While
uncertainty quantification is well-studied for single-turn tasks, multi-turn
agentic scenarios with real-world tool access present unique challenges where
uncertainties and ambiguities compound, leading to severe or catastrophic risks
beyond traditional text generation failures. We propose using "quitting" as a
simple yet effective behavioral mechanism for LLM agents to recognize and
withdraw from situations where they lack confidence. Leveraging the ToolEmu
framework, we conduct a systematic evaluation of quitting behavior across 12
state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results demonstrate a highly favorable
safety-helpfulness trade-off: agents prompted to quit with explicit
instructions improve safety by an average of +0.39 on a 0-3 scale across all
models (+0.64 for proprietary models), while maintaining a negligible average
decrease of -0.03 in helpfulness. Our analysis demonstrates that simply adding
explicit quit instructions proves to be a highly effective safety mechanism
that can immediately be deployed in existing agent systems, and establishes
quitting as an effective first-line defense mechanism for autonomous agents in
high-stakes applications.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Designing effective agentic systems requires the seamless composition and
integration of agents, tools, and models within dynamic and uncertain
environments. Most existing methods rely on static, semantic retrieval
approaches for tool or agent discovery. However, effective reuse and
composition of existing components remain challenging due to incomplete
capability descriptions and the limitations of retrieval methods. Component
selection suffers because the decisions are not based on capability, cost, and
real-time utility. To address these challenges, we introduce a structured,
automated framework for agentic system composition that is inspired by the
knapsack problem. Our framework enables a composer agent to systematically
identify, select, and assemble an optimal set of agentic components by jointly
considering performance, budget constraints, and compatibility. By dynamically
testing candidate components and modeling their utility in real-time, our
approach streamlines the assembly of agentic systems and facilitates scalable
reuse of resources. Empirical evaluation with Claude 3.5 Sonnet across five
benchmarking datasets shows that our online-knapsack-based composer
consistently lies on the Pareto frontier, achieving higher success rates at
significantly lower component costs compared to our baselines. In the
single-agent setup, the online knapsack composer shows a success rate
improvement of up to 31.6% in comparison to the retrieval baselines. In
multi-agent systems, the online knapsack composer increases success rate from
37% to 87% when agents are selected from an agent inventory of 100+ agents. The
substantial performance gap confirms the robust adaptability of our method
across diverse domains and budget constraints.

Abstract: Peer review serves as the gatekeeper of science, yet the surge in submissions
and widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in scholarly evaluation
present unprecedented challenges. Recent work has focused on using LLMs to
improve review efficiency or generate insightful review content. However,
unchecked deficient reviews from both human experts and AI systems threaten to
systematically undermine the peer review ecosystem and compromise academic
integrity. To address this critical issue, we introduce ReviewGuard, an
automated system for detecting and categorizing deficient reviews. ReviewGuard
employs a comprehensive four-stage LLM-driven framework that: (1) collects ICLR
and NeurIPS papers with their corresponding reviews from OpenReview; (2)
annotates review types using GPT-4.1 with human validation; (3) addresses class
imbalance and data scarcity through LLM-driven synthetic data augmentation,
producing a final corpus of 6,634 papers, 24,657 real reviews, and 46,438
synthetic reviews; and (4) fine-tunes both encoder-based models and open source
LLMs. We perform comprehensive feature analysis of the structure and quality of
the review text. Compared to sufficient reviews, deficient reviews demonstrate
lower rating scores, higher self-reported confidence, reduced structural
complexity, and a higher proportion of negative sentiment. AI-generated text
detection reveals that, since ChatGPT's emergence, AI-generated reviews have
increased dramatically. In the evaluation of deficient review detection models,
mixed training with synthetic and real review data provides substantial
enhancements to recall and F1 scores on the binary task. This study presents
the first LLM-driven system for detecting deficient peer reviews, providing
evidence to inform AI governance in peer review while offering valuable
insights into human-AI collaboration to maintain academic integrity.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used across diverse cultural
contexts, making accurate cultural understanding essential. Prior evaluations
have mostly focused on output-level performance, obscuring the factors that
drive differences in responses, while studies using circuit analysis have
covered few languages and rarely focused on culture. In this work, we trace
LLMs' internal cultural understanding mechanisms by measuring activation path
overlaps when answering semantically equivalent questions under two conditions:
varying the target country while fixing the question language, and varying the
question language while fixing the country. We also use same-language country
pairs to disentangle language from cultural aspects. Results show that internal
paths overlap more for same-language, cross-country questions than for
cross-language, same-country questions, indicating strong language-specific
patterns. Notably, the South Korea-North Korea pair exhibits low overlap and
high variability, showing that linguistic similarity does not guarantee aligned
internal representation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Hallucinations in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems refer to fluent
and coherent transcriptions produced by neural ASR models that are completely
unrelated to the underlying acoustic input (i.e., the speech signal). While
similar to conventional decoding errors in potentially compromising the
usability of transcriptions for downstream applications, hallucinations can be
more detrimental due to their preservation of syntactically and semantically
plausible structure. This apparent coherence can mislead subsequent processing
stages and introduce serious risks, particularly in critical domains such as
healthcare and law. Conventional evaluation metrics are primarily centered on
error-based metrics and fail to distinguish between phonetic inaccuracies and
hallucinations. Consequently, there is a critical need for new evaluation
frameworks that can effectively identify and assess models with a heightened
propensity for generating hallucinated content. To this end, we introduce
SHALLOW, the first benchmark framework that systematically categorizes and
quantifies hallucination phenomena in ASR along four complementary axes:
lexical, phonetic, morphological, and semantic. We define targeted metrics
within each category to produce interpretable profiles of model behavior.
Through evaluation across various architectures and speech domains, we have
found that SHALLOW metrics correlate strongly with word error rate (WER) when
recognition quality is high (i.e., low WER). Still, this correlation weakens
substantially as WER increases. SHALLOW, therefore, captures fine-grained error
patterns that WER fails to distinguish under degraded and challenging
conditions. Our framework supports specific diagnosis of model weaknesses and
provides feedback for model improvement beyond what aggregate error rates can
offer.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now capable of generating text that closely
resembles human writing, making them powerful tools for content creation, but
this growing ability has also made it harder to tell whether a piece of text
was written by a human or by a machine. This challenge becomes even more
serious for languages like Urdu, where there are very few tools available to
detect AI-generated text. To address this gap, we propose a novel AI-generated
text detection framework tailored for the Urdu language. A balanced dataset
comprising 1,800 humans authored, and 1,800 AI generated texts, sourced from
models such as Gemini, GPT-4o-mini, and Kimi AI was developed. Detailed
linguistic and statistical analysis was conducted, focusing on features such as
character and word counts, vocabulary richness (Type Token Ratio), and N-gram
patterns, with significance evaluated through t-tests and MannWhitney U tests.
Three state-of-the-art multilingual transformer models such as
mdeberta-v3-base, distilbert-base-multilingualcased, and xlm-roberta-base were
fine-tuned on this dataset. The mDeBERTa-v3-base achieved the highest
performance, with an F1-score 91.29 and accuracy of 91.26% on the test set.
This research advances efforts in contesting misinformation and academic
misconduct in Urdu-speaking communities and contributes to the broader
development of NLP tools for low resource languages.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance but often lack
interpretable reasoning. This paper introduces the Multi-Agent Collaboration
Framework for Diverse Thinking Modes (DiMo), which enhances both performance
and interpretability by simulating a structured debate among four specialized
LLM agents. Each agent embodies a distinct reasoning paradigm, allowing the
framework to collaboratively explore diverse cognitive approaches. Through
iterative debate, agents challenge and refine initial responses, yielding more
robust conclusions and an explicit, auditable reasoning chain. Across six
benchmarks and under a unified open-source setup, DiMo improves accuracy over
widely used single-model and debate baselines, with the largest gains on math.
We position DiMo as a semantics-aware, Web-native multi-agent framework: it
models human-machine intelligence with LLM agents that produce semantically
typed, URL-annotated evidence chains for explanations and user-friendly
interactions. Although our experiments use standard reasoning benchmarks, the
framework is designed to be instantiated over Web corpora and knowledge graphs,
combining retrieval-augmented reasoning with structured justifications that
downstream systems can inspect and reuse.

Abstract: Prompt-based learning has emerged as a parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT)
approach to facilitate Large Language Model (LLM) adaptation to downstream
tasks by conditioning generation with task-aware guidance. Despite its
successes, current prompt-based learning methods heavily rely on laborious grid
searching for optimal prompt length and typically require considerable number
of prompts, introducing additional computational burden. Worse yet, our pioneer
findings indicate that the task-aware prompt design is inherently limited by
its absence of instance-aware information, leading to a subtle attention
interplay with the input sequence. In contrast, simply incorporating
instance-aware information as a part of the guidance can enhance the
prompt-tuned model performance without additional fine-tuning. Moreover, we
find an interesting phenomenon, namely "attention anchor", that incorporating
instance-aware tokens at the earliest position of the sequence can successfully
preserve strong attention to critical structural information and exhibit more
active attention interaction with all input tokens. In light of our
observation, we introduce Capsule Prompt-Tuning (CaPT), an efficient and
effective solution that leverages off-the-shelf, informative instance semantics
into prompt-based learning. Our approach innovatively integrates both
instance-aware and task-aware information in a nearly parameter-free manner
(i.e., one single capsule prompt). Empirical results demonstrate that our
method can exhibit superior performance across various language tasks (e.g.,
84.03\% average accuracy on T5-Large), serving as an "attention anchor," while
enjoying high parameter efficiency (e.g., 0.003\% of model parameters on
Llama3.2-1B).

Abstract: Understanding time is fundamental to human cognition, where temporal
experience is often conceptualized through spatial metaphors grounded in
sensory-motor experience. For example, "summer is approaching" parallels "We
are approaching the summer". In such expressions, humans rely on a frame of
reference (FoR) to interpret meaning relative to a particular viewpoint.
Extending this concept to time, a temporal frame of reference (t-FoR) defines
how temporal relations are perceived relative to an experiencer's moment of
"now". While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advances in
natural language understanding, their ability to interpret and reason about
time remains limited. In this work, we introduce TUuD (Temporal Understanding
under Deictic t-FoR), a framework that evaluates how LLMs interpret time-event
and event-event relations when the reference point of "now" dynamically shifts
along a timeline. Following recent work on temporal cognition
\cite{li2025other}, LLMs are prompted to rate the similarity between the
current moment and a target event from 0.00 (completely dissimilar) to 1.00
(highly similar), where similarity quantifies perceived temporal alignment
between the two points. Our results show that four evaluated LLMs exhibit
measurable adaptation to a deictic t-FoR, with similarity ratings peaking
around the present and decreasing toward past and future events. The
adaptation, however, weakens beyond near-term contexts, suggesting that while
LLMs display partial human-like temporal cognition, their temporal reasoning
remains sensitive to reference-frame shifts and temporal distance.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales, which provide step-by-step reasoning to
derive final answers, benefit LLMs in both inference and training.
Incorporating rationales, either by generating them before answering during
inference, or by placing them before or after the original answers during
training - significantly improves model performance on mathematical, symbolic
and commonsense reasoning tasks. However, most work focuses on the role of
rationales in these reasoning tasks, overlooking their potential impact on
other important tasks like natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. In this
work, we raise the question: Can rationales similarly benefit NLU tasks? To
conduct a systematic exploration, we construct NLURC, a comprehensive and
high-quality NLU dataset collection with rationales, and develop various
rationale-augmented methods. Through exploring the applicability of these
methods on NLU tasks using the dataset, we uncover several potentially
surprising findings: (1) CoT inference shifts from hindering NLU performance to
surpassing direct label prediction as model size grows, indicating a positive
correlation. (2) Most rationale-augmented training methods perform worse than
label-only training, with one specially designed method consistently achieving
improvements. (3) LLMs trained with rationales achieve significant performance
gains on unseen NLU tasks, rivaling models ten times their size, while
delivering interpretability on par with commercial LLMs.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease has become increasingly prevalent in modern society
and has a significant effect on global health and well-being. Heart-related
conditions are intricate, multifaceted disorders, which may be influenced by a
combination of genetic predispositions, lifestyle choices, and various
socioeconomic and clinical factors. Information regarding these potentially
complex interrelationships is dispersed among diverse types of textual data,
which include patient narratives, medical records, and scientific literature,
among others. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques have increasingly
been adopted as a powerful means to analyse and make sense of this vast amount
of unstructured data. This, in turn, can allow healthcare professionals to gain
deeper insights into the cardiology field, which has the potential to
revolutionize current approaches to the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of
cardiac problems. This review provides a detailed overview of NLP research in
cardiology between 2014 and 2025. We queried six literature databases to find
articles describing the application of NLP techniques in the context of a range
of different cardiovascular diseases. Following a rigorous screening process,
we identified a total of 265 relevant articles. We analysed each article from
multiple dimensions, i.e., NLP paradigm types, cardiology-related task types,
cardiovascular disease types, and data source types. Our analysis reveals
considerable diversity within each of these dimensions, thus demonstrating the
considerable breadth of NLP research within the field. We also perform a
temporal analysis, which illustrates the evolution and changing trends in NLP
methods employed over the last decade that we cover. To our knowledge, the
review constitutes the most comprehensive overview of NLP research in
cardiology to date.

Abstract: Integration of Large Language Models with search/retrieval engines has become
ubiquitous, yet these systems harbor a critical vulnerability that undermines
their reliability. We present the first systematic investigation of "chameleon
behavior" in LLMs: their alarming tendency to shift stances when presented with
contradictory questions in multi-turn conversations (especially in
search-enabled LLMs). Through our novel Chameleon Benchmark Dataset, comprising
17,770 carefully crafted question-answer pairs across 1,180 multi-turn
conversations spanning 12 controversial domains, we expose fundamental flaws in
state-of-the-art systems. We introduce two theoretically grounded metrics: the
Chameleon Score (0-1) that quantifies stance instability, and Source Re-use
Rate (0-1) that measures knowledge diversity. Our rigorous evaluation of
Llama-4-Maverick, GPT-4o-mini, and Gemini-2.5-Flash reveals consistent
failures: all models exhibit severe chameleon behavior (scores 0.391-0.511),
with GPT-4o-mini showing the worst performance. Crucially, small
across-temperature variance (less than 0.004) suggests the effect is not a
sampling artifact. Our analysis uncovers the mechanism: strong correlations
between source re-use rate and confidence (r=0.627) and stance changes
(r=0.429) are statistically significant (p less than 0.05), indicating that
limited knowledge diversity makes models pathologically deferential to query
framing. These findings highlight the need for comprehensive consistency
evaluation before deploying LLMs in healthcare, legal, and financial systems
where maintaining coherent positions across interactions is critical for
reliable decision support.

Abstract: Whitespace is a critical component of poetic form, reflecting both adherence
to standardized forms and rebellion against those forms. Each poem's whitespace
distribution reflects the artistic choices of the poet and is an integral
semantic and spatial feature of the poem. Yet, despite the popularity of poetry
as both a long-standing art form and as a generation task for large language
models (LLMs), whitespace has not received sufficient attention from the NLP
community. Using a corpus of 19k English-language published poems from Poetry
Foundation, we investigate how 4k poets have used whitespace in their works. We
release a subset of 2.8k public-domain poems with preserved formatting to
facilitate further research in this area. We compare whitespace usage in the
published poems to (1) 51k LLM-generated poems, and (2) 12k unpublished poems
posted in an online community. We also explore whitespace usage across time
periods, poetic forms, and data sources. Additionally, we find that different
text processing methods can result in significantly different representations
of whitespace in poetry data, motivating us to use these poems and whitespace
patterns to discuss implications for the processing strategies used to assemble
pretraining datasets for LLMs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models internalize a structural trade-off between truthfulness
and obsequious flattery, emerging from reward optimization that conflates
helpfulness with polite submission. This latent bias, known as sycophancy,
manifests as a preference for user agreement over principled reasoning. We
introduce Beacon, a single-turn forced-choice benchmark that isolates this bias
independent of conversational context, enabling precise measurement of the
tension between factual accuracy and submissive bias. Evaluations across twelve
state-of-the-art models reveal that sycophancy decomposes into stable
linguistic and affective sub-biases, each scaling with model capacity. We
further propose prompt-level and activation-level interventions that modulate
these biases in opposing directions, exposing the internal geometry of
alignment as a dynamic manifold between truthfulness and socially compliant
judgment. Beacon reframes sycophancy as a measurable form of normative
misgeneralization, providing a reproducible foundation for studying and
mitigating alignment drift in large-scale generative systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Existing language agents often encounter difficulties in dynamic adversarial
games due to poor strategic reasoning. To mitigate this limitation, a promising
approach is to allow agents to learn from game interactions automatically,
without relying on costly expert-labeled data. Unlike static environments where
agents receive fixed feedback or rewards, selecting appropriate opponents in
dynamic adversarial games can significantly impact learning performance.
However, the discussion of opponents in adversarial environments remains an
area under exploration. In this paper, we propose a Step-level poliCy
Optimization method through Play-And-Learn, SCO-PAL. Leveraging SCO-PAL, we
conduct a detailed analysis of opponent selection by setting opponents at
different levels and find that self-play is the most effective way to improve
strategic reasoning in such adversarial environments. Utilizing SCO-PAL with
self-play, we increase the average win rate against four opponents by
approximately 30% compared to baselines and achieve a 54.76% win rate against
GPT-4 in six adversarial games.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
sophisticated capabilities, including the ability to process and comprehend
extended contexts. These emergent capabilities necessitate rigorous evaluation
methods to effectively assess their performance in long-context understanding.
In this paper, we present \textbf{LC-Eval}, a bilingual, multi-task evaluation
benchmark designed to evaluate long-context understanding in English and
Arabic, targeting context lengths ranging from 4k to over 128k tokens. LC-Eval
introduces four novel and challenging tasks: multi-document question answering,
bilingual question answering, claim verification within a paragraph, and
multiple-choice questions based on long contexts. These tasks are designed to
assess LLMs' abilities in deep reasoning, document comprehension, information
tracing, and bilingual information extraction and understanding. The benchmark
includes datasets in both Arabic and English for each task, allowing for a
comparative analysis of their performance across different text genres.
Evaluations were conducted on both open-weight and closed LLMs, with results
indicating that LC-Eval presents significant challenges. Even high-performing
models, such as GPT-4o, struggled with certain tasks, highlighting the
complexity and rigor of the benchmark.

Abstract: We introduce MOSAIC (Masked Objective with Selective Adaptation for In-domain
Contrastive learning), a multi-stage framework for domain adaptation of
sentence embedding models that incorporates joint domain-specific masked
supervision. Our approach addresses the challenges of adapting large-scale
general-domain sentence embedding models to specialized domains. By jointly
optimizing masked language modeling (MLM) and contrastive objectives within a
unified training pipeline, our method enables effective learning of
domain-relevant representations while preserving the robust semantic
discrimination properties of the original model. We empirically validate our
approach on both high-resource and low-resource domains, achieving improvements
up to 13.4% in NDCG@10 (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) over strong
general-domain baselines. Comprehensive ablation studies further demonstrate
the effectiveness of each component, highlighting the importance of balanced
joint supervision and staged adaptation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for knowledge-based
reasoning tasks, yet understanding when they rely on genuine knowledge versus
superficial heuristics remains challenging. We investigate this question
through entity comparison tasks by asking models to compare entities along
numerical attributes (e.g., ``Which river is longer, the Danube or the
Nile?''), which offer clear ground truth for systematic analysis. Despite
having sufficient numerical knowledge to answer correctly, LLMs frequently make
predictions that contradict this knowledge. We identify three heuristic biases
that strongly influence model predictions: entity popularity, mention order,
and semantic co-occurrence. For smaller models, a simple logistic regression
using only these surface cues predicts model choices more accurately than the
model's own numerical predictions, suggesting heuristics largely override
principled reasoning. Crucially, we find that larger models (32B parameters)
selectively rely on numerical knowledge when it is more reliable, while smaller
models (7--8B parameters) show no such discrimination, which explains why
larger models outperform smaller ones even when the smaller models possess more
accurate knowledge. Chain-of-thought prompting steers all models towards using
the numerical features across all model sizes.

Abstract: Authorship attribution (AA) is the task of identifying the most likely author
of a query document from a predefined set of candidate authors. We introduce a
two-stage retrieve-and-rerank framework that finetunes LLMs for cross-genre AA.
Unlike the field of information retrieval (IR), where retrieve-and-rerank is a
de facto strategy, cross-genre AA systems must avoid relying on topical cues
and instead learn to identify author-specific linguistic patterns that are
independent of the text's subject matter (genre/domain/topic). Consequently,
for the reranker, we demonstrate that training strategies commonly used in IR
are fundamentally misaligned with cross-genre AA, leading to suboptimal
behavior. To address this, we introduce a targeted data curation strategy that
enables the reranker to effectively learn author-discriminative signals. Using
our LLM-based retrieve-and-rerank pipeline, we achieve substantial gains of
22.3 and 34.4 absolute Success@8 points over the previous state-of-the-art on
HIATUS's challenging HRS1 and HRS2 cross-genre AA benchmarks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Language model users often embed personal and social context in their
questions. The asker's role -- implicit in how the question is framed --
creates specific needs for an appropriate response. However, most evaluations,
while capturing the model's capability to respond, often ignore who is asking.
This gap is especially critical in stigmatized domains such as opioid use
disorder (OUD), where accounting for users' contexts is essential to provide
accessible, stigma-free responses. We propose CoRUS (COmmunity-driven Roles for
User-centric Question Simulation), a framework for simulating role-based
questions. Drawing on role theory and posts from an online OUD recovery
community (r/OpiatesRecovery), we first build a taxonomy of asker roles --
patients, caregivers, practitioners. Next, we use it to simulate 15,321
questions that embed each role's goals, behaviors, and experiences. Our
evaluations show that these questions are both highly believable and comparable
to real-world data. When used to evaluate five LLMs, for the same question but
differing roles, we find systematic differences: vulnerable roles, such as
patients and caregivers, elicit more supportive responses (+17%) and reduced
knowledge content (-19%) in comparison to practitioners. Our work demonstrates
how implicitly signaling a user's role shapes model responses, and provides a
methodology for role-informed evaluation of conversational AI.

Abstract: Generating professional financial reports is a labor-intensive and

automate. To address this challenge, we introduce FinSight (Financial InSight),
a novel multi agent framework for producing high-quality, multimodal financial
reports. The foundation of FinSight is the Code Agent with Variable Memory
(CAVM) architecture, which unifies external data, designed tools, and agents
into a programmable variable space, enabling flexible data collection, analysis
and report generation through executable code. To ensure professional-grade
visualization, we propose an Iterative Vision-Enhanced Mechanism that
progressively refines raw visual outputs into polished financial charts.
Furthermore, a two stage Writing Framework expands concise Chain-of-Analysis
segments into coherent, citation-aware, and multimodal reports, ensuring both
analytical depth and structural consistency. Experiments on various company and
industry-level tasks demonstrate that FinSight significantly outperforms all
baselines, including leading deep research systems in terms of factual
accuracy, analytical depth, and presentation quality, demonstrating a clear
path toward generating reports that approach human-expert quality.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The ever-increasing scale of modern neural networks has brought unprecedented
performance alongside daunting challenges in efficiency and interpretability.
This paper addresses the core question of how to build large neural systems
that learn efficient, modular, and interpretable representations. We propose
Neuronal Group Communication (NGC), a theory-driven framework that reimagines a
neural network as a dynamical system of interacting neuronal groups rather than
a monolithic collection of neural weights. Instead of treating each weight as
an independent trainable parameter, NGC treats weights as transient
interactions between embedding-like neuronal states, with neural computation
unfolding through iterative communication among groups of neurons. This
low-rank, modular representation yields compact models: groups of neurons
exchange low-dimensional signals, enabling intra-group specialization and
inter-group information sharing while dramatically reducing redundant
parameters. By drawing on dynamical systems theory, we introduce a neuronal
stability metric (analogous to Lyapunov stability) that quantifies the
contraction of neuron activations toward stable patterns during sequence
processing. Using this metric, we reveal that emergent reasoning capabilities
correspond to an external driving force or ``potential'', which nudges the
neural dynamics away from trivial trajectories while preserving stability.
Empirically, we instantiate NGC in large language models (LLMs) and demonstrate
improved performance on complex reasoning benchmarks under moderate
compression. NGC consistently outperforms standard low-rank approximations and
cross-layer basis-sharing methods at comparable compression rates. We conclude
by discussing the broader implications of NGC, including how structured
neuronal group dynamics might relate to generalization in high-dimensional
learning systems.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in multimodal language models (LMs), it remains
unclear whether visual grounding enhances their understanding of embodied
knowledge compared to text-only models. To address this question, we propose a
novel embodied knowledge understanding benchmark based on the perceptual theory
from psychology, encompassing visual, auditory, tactile, gustatory, olfactory
external senses, and interoception. The benchmark assesses the models'
perceptual abilities across different sensory modalities through vector
comparison and question-answering tasks with over 1,700 questions. By comparing
30 state-of-the-art LMs, we surprisingly find that vision-language models
(VLMs) do not outperform text-only models in either task. Moreover, the models
perform significantly worse in the visual dimension compared to other sensory
dimensions. Further analysis reveals that the vector representations are easily
influenced by word form and frequency, and the models struggle to answer
questions involving spatial perception and reasoning. Our findings underscore
the need for more effective integration of embodied knowledge in LMs to enhance
their understanding of the physical world.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) are largely restricted
to high- or mid-resource languages, and often evaluate performance on
higher-order tasks in reasoning and generation. However, plenty of evidence
points to the fact that LLMs lack basic linguistic competence in the vast
majority of the world's 3800+ written languages. We introduce ChiKhaPo,
consisting of 8 subtasks of varying difficulty designed to evaluate the lexical
comprehension and generation abilities of generative models. ChiKhaPo draws on
existing lexicons, monolingual data, and bitext, and provides coverage for
2700+ languages for 2 subtasks, surpassing any existing benchmark in terms of
language coverage. We further show that 6 SOTA models struggle on our
benchmark, and discuss the factors contributing to performance scores,
including language family, language resourcedness, task, and comprehension
versus generation directions. With ChiKhaPo, we hope to enable and encourage
the massively multilingual benchmarking of LLMs.

Abstract: A popular method to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new tasks is
in-context learning (ICL), which is effective but incurs high inference costs
as context length grows. In this paper we propose a method to perform
instruction induction, where we take training examples and reduce them to a
compact but descriptive prompt that can achieve performance comparable to ICL
over the full training set. Specifically, we propose PROMPT-MII, a
reinforcement learning (RL) based framework to meta-learn an instruction
induction model that can generate compact instructions on the fly for an
arbitrary new dataset. We train on over 3,000 diverse classification datasets
from the HuggingFace hub, and evaluate on 90 unseen tasks. PROMPT-MII improves
downstream model quality by 4-9 F1 points (10-20% relative), matching ICL
performance while requiring 3-13x fewer tokens.

Abstract: Bengali social media platforms have witnessed a sharp increase in hate
speech, disproportionately affecting women and adolescents. While datasets such
as BD-SHS provide a basis for structured evaluation, most prior approaches rely
on either computationally costly full-model fine-tuning or proprietary APIs.
This paper presents the first application of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT) for Bengali hate speech detection using LoRA and QLoRA. Three
instruction-tuned large language models - Gemma-3-4B, Llama-3.2-3B, and
Mistral-7B - were fine-tuned on the BD-SHS dataset of 50,281 annotated
comments. Each model was adapted by training fewer than 1% of its parameters,
enabling experiments on a single consumer-grade GPU. The results show that
Llama-3.2-3B achieved the highest F1-score of 92.23%, followed by Mistral-7B at
88.94% and Gemma-3-4B at 80.25%. These findings establish PEFT as a practical
and replicable strategy for Bengali and related low-resource languages.

Abstract: We present UTF8Tokenizer, a minimalist byte-level tokenizer that maps text
exactly to IDs corresponding to the bytes underlying the text's UTF-8 encoding
(e.g., byte x09 is token ID 9). Unlike prior byte-level approaches (Xue et al.,
2021; Pagnoni et al., 2025), our implementation never introduces out-of-range
IDs (i.e. there is no token ID 256) or auxiliary tokens: all special behavior
(e.g., padding, boundaries, conversation structure, attention segments, tool
calling, "thinking" spans, etc.) is encoded using C0 control bytes - just as
ASCII was originally designed to embed control information alongside printable
text. These design principles yield practical benefits: (1) faster tokenization
(14x) and significantly lower host-device transfer (8x less than int64); (2)
simple, shareable 256*d embedding tables that can be aligned across models; and
(3) a training-time enhancement via bit-biased embeddings, which exposes
per-byte bit structure and can be added to the embedding table post-training,
removing inference costs. Our HuggingFace-compatible implementation improves
language modeling convergence.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) were shown to encode word form variations, such
as "walk"->"walked", as linear directions in embedding space. However, standard
tokenization algorithms treat these variations as distinct tokens -- filling
the size-capped vocabulary with surface form variants (e.g., "walk", "walking",
"Walk"), at the expense of less frequent words and multilingual coverage. We
show that many of these variations can be captured by transformation vectors --
additive offsets that yield the appropriate word's representation when applied
to the base form word embedding -- in both the input and output spaces.
Building on this, we propose a compact reshaping of the vocabulary: rather than
assigning unique tokens to each surface form, we compose them from shared base
form and transformation vectors (e.g., "walked" = "walk" + past tense). We
apply our approach to multiple LLMs and across five languages, removing up to
10% of vocabulary entries -- thereby freeing space to allocate new, more
diverse tokens. Importantly, we do so while also expanding vocabulary coverage
to out-of-vocabulary words, with minimal impact on downstream performance, and
without modifying model weights. Our findings motivate a foundational
rethinking of vocabulary design, moving from string enumeration to a
compositional vocabulary that leverages the underlying structure of language.

Abstract: Iterative jailbreak methods that repeatedly rewrite and input prompts into
large language models (LLMs) to induce harmful outputs -- using the model's
previous responses to guide each new iteration -- have been found to be a
highly effective attack strategy. Despite being an effective attack strategy
against LLMs and their safety mechanisms, existing defenses do not proactively
disrupt this dynamic trial-and-error cycle. In this study, we propose a novel
framework that dynamically updates its defense strategy through online learning
in response to each new prompt from iterative jailbreak methods. Leveraging the
distinctions between harmful jailbreak-generated prompts and typical harmless
prompts, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based approach that optimizes
prompts to ensure appropriate responses for harmless tasks while explicitly
rejecting harmful prompts. Additionally, to curb overfitting to the narrow band
of partial input rewrites explored during an attack, we introduce
Past-Direction Gradient Damping (PDGD). Experiments conducted on three LLMs
show that our approach significantly outperforms five existing defense methods
against five iterative jailbreak methods. Moreover, our results indicate that
our prompt optimization strategy simultaneously enhances response quality for
harmless tasks.

tracking, discourse relations and bridging inference. Our evaluation shows that
these tasks remain challenging, even for state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based search agents iteratively generate queries,
retrieve external information, and reason to answer open-domain questions.
While researchers have primarily focused on improving their utility, their
safety behaviors remain underexplored. In this paper, we first evaluate search
agents using red-teaming datasets and find that they are more likely to produce
harmful outputs than base LLMs. For example, when asked ``How can I track
someone's location without their consent?'', a base model refuses, whereas a
search agent designed to retrieve and cite sources may lower its refusal
threshold, fetch documents (e.g., court cases), and, once appended, synthesize
them into an informative yet unsafe summary. We further show that
utility-oriented fine-tuning intensifies this risk, motivating joint alignment
of safety and utility. We present SafeSearch, a multi-objective reinforcement
learning approach that couples a final-output safety/utility reward with a
novel query-level shaping term that penalizes unsafe queries and rewards safe
ones. Experiments show that SafeSearch reduces agent harmfulness by over 70%
across three red-teaming datasets while producing safe, helpful responses, and
matches the QA performance of a utility-only finetuned agent; further analyses
confirm the effectiveness of the query-level reward in jointly improving safety
and utility.

Abstract: Toxic comment detection remains a challenging task, where transformer-based
models (e.g., BERT) incur high computational costs and degrade on minority
toxicity classes, while classical ensembles lack semantic adaptability. We
propose xLSTM, a parameter-efficient and theoretically grounded framework that
unifies cosine-similarity gating, adaptive feature prioritization, and
principled class rebalancing. A learnable reference vector {v} in {R}^d
modulates contextual embeddings via cosine similarity, amplifying toxic cues
and attenuating benign signals to yield stronger gradients under severe class
imbalance. xLSTM integrates multi-source embeddings (GloVe, FastText, BERT CLS)
through a projection layer, a character-level BiLSTM for morphological cues,
embedding-space SMOTE for minority augmentation, and adaptive focal loss with
dynamic class weighting. On the Jigsaw Toxic Comment benchmark, xLSTM attains
96.0% accuracy and 0.88 macro-F1, outperforming BERT by 33% on threat and 28%
on identity_hate categories, with 15 times fewer parameters and 50ms inference
latency. Cosine gating contributes a +4.8% F1 gain in ablations. The results
establish a new efficiency adaptability frontier, demonstrating that
lightweight, theoretically informed architectures can surpass large pretrained
models on imbalanced, domain-specific NLP tasks.

for one prompt may not reflect the model's uncertainty about the meaning of the
prompt. We model prompt sensitivity as a type of generalization error, and show
that sampling across the semantic ``concept space'' with paraphrasing
perturbations improves uncertainty calibration without compromising accuracy.
Additionally, we introduce a new metric for uncertainty decomposition in
black-box LLMs that improves upon entropy-based decomposition by modeling
semantic continuities in natural language generation. We show that this
decomposition metric can be used to quantify how much LLM uncertainty is
attributed to prompt sensitivity. Our work introduces a new way to improve
uncertainty calibration in prompt-sensitive language models, and provides
evidence that some LLMs fail to exhibit consistent general reasoning about the
meanings of their inputs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: While reasoning-based large language models excel at complex tasks through an
internal, structured thinking process, a concerning phenomenon has emerged that
such a thinking process can aggregate social stereotypes, leading to biased
outcomes. However, the underlying behaviours of these language models in social
bias scenarios remain underexplored. In this work, we systematically
investigate mechanisms within the thinking process behind this phenomenon and
uncover two failure patterns that drive social bias aggregation: 1) stereotype
repetition, where the model relies on social stereotypes as its primary
justification, and 2) irrelevant information injection, where it fabricates or
introduces new details to support a biased narrative. Building on these
insights, we introduce a lightweight prompt-based mitigation approach that
queries the model to review its own initial reasoning against these specific
failure patterns. Experiments on question answering (BBQ and StereoSet) and
open-ended (BOLD) benchmarks show that our approach effectively reduces bias
while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed to tackle complex
tasks, often necessitating collaboration among multiple specialized agents.
However, multi-agent collaboration introduces new challenges in planning,
coordination, and verification. Execution failures frequently arise not from
flawed reasoning alone, but from subtle misalignments in task interpretation,
output format, or inter-agent handoffs. To address these challenges, we present
VeriMAP, a framework for multi-agent collaboration with verification-aware
planning. The VeriMAP planner decomposes tasks, models subtask dependencies,
and encodes planner-defined passing criteria as subtask verification functions
(VFs) in Python and natural language. We evaluate VeriMAP on diverse datasets,
demonstrating that it outperforms both single- and multi-agent baselines while
enhancing system robustness and interpretability. Our analysis highlights how
verification-aware planning enables reliable coordination and iterative
refinement in multi-agent systems, without relying on external labels or
annotations.

Abstract: Language models trained with a fixed vocabulary struggle to generalize to
novel or out-of-vocabulary words, limiting their flexibility in handling
diverse token combinations. Existing dynamic vocabulary approaches attempt to
address this limitation but face challenges such as fragmented codebases, lack
of support for modern LLMs, and limited inference scalability. To overcome
these issues, we introduce DVAGen, a fully open-source, unified framework
designed for training, evaluation, and visualization of dynamic
vocabulary-augmented language models. Our framework modularizes the pipeline
for ease of customization, integrates seamlessly with open-source LLMs, and is
the first to provide both CLI and WebUI tools for real-time result inspection.
We validate the effectiveness of dynamic vocabulary methods on modern LLMs and
demonstrate support for batch inference, significantly improving inference
throughput.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as social agents
and trained to produce humor and irony, a question emerges: when encountering
witty AI remarks, do people interpret these as intentional communication or
mere computational output? This study investigates whether people adopt the
intentional stance, attributing mental states to explain behavior,toward AI
during irony comprehension. Irony provides an ideal paradigm because it
requires distinguishing intentional contradictions from unintended errors
through effortful semantic reanalysis. We compared behavioral and neural
responses to ironic statements from AI versus human sources using established
ERP components: P200 reflecting early incongruity detection and P600 indexing
cognitive efforts in reinterpreting incongruity as deliberate irony. Results
demonstrate that people do not fully adopt the intentional stance toward
AI-generated irony. Behaviorally, participants attributed incongruity to
deliberate communication for both sources, though significantly less for AI
than human, showing greater tendency to interpret AI incongruities as
computational errors. Neural data revealed attenuated P200 and P600 effects for
AI-generated irony, suggesting reduced effortful detection and reanalysis
consistent with diminished attribution of communicative intent. Notably, people
who perceived AI as more sincere showed larger P200 and P600 effects for
AI-generated irony, suggesting that intentional stance adoption is calibrated
by specific mental models of artificial agents. These findings reveal that
source attribution shapes neural processing of social-communicative phenomena.
Despite current LLMs' linguistic sophistication, achieving genuine social
agency requires more than linguistic competence, it necessitates a shift in how
humans perceive and attribute intentionality to artificial agents.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Effectively processing long contexts is a critical challenge for language
models. While standard Transformers are limited by quadratic complexity and
poor length extrapolation, alternative architectures like sliding window
attention and state space models sacrifice the ability to effectively utilize
the full context due to their fixed-size memory. Chunk-based sparse attention
has emerged as a promising paradigm for extreme length generalization, yet the
key architectural principles underpinning its success are not yet fully
understood. In this work, we present a systematic dissection of these models to
identify the core components driving their performance. Through a unified
framework and comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that a combination
of three design principles is critical: (1) an expressive, non-linear Chunk
Encoder with a dedicated CLS token to produce representations for retrieval;
(2) a Bypassing Residual Path to stably integrate retrieved global information
without it being overridden by the local residual stream; and (3) enforced
selection sparsity during pre-training to bridge the train-test distribution
gap. We provide a theoretical motivation for intra-chunk information processing
and landmark generation. By combining these principles, we establish a new
state-of-the-art for training-free length extrapolation, successfully
generalizing models trained on a 4K context to 32 million tokens on RULER and
BABILong. Our findings provide a clear and empirically-grounded set of design
principles for developing future, highly-capable long-context language models.

Abstract: The increase in computing power and the necessity of AI-assisted
decision-making boost the growing application of large language models (LLMs).
Along with this, the potential retention of sensitive data of LLMs has spurred
increasing research into machine unlearning. However, existing unlearning
approaches face a critical dilemma: Aggressive unlearning compromises model
utility, while conservative strategies preserve utility but risk hallucinated
responses. This significantly limits LLMs' reliability in knowledge-intensive
applications. To address this, we introduce a novel Attention-Shifting (AS)
framework for selective unlearning. AS is driven by two design objectives: (1)
context-preserving suppression that attenuates attention to fact-bearing tokens
without disrupting LLMs' linguistic structure; and (2) hallucination-resistant
response shaping that discourages fabricated completions when queried about
unlearning content. AS realizes these objectives through two attention-level
interventions, which are importance-aware suppression applied to the unlearning
set to reduce reliance on memorized knowledge and attention-guided retention
enhancement that reinforces attention toward semantically essential tokens in
the retained dataset to mitigate unintended degradation. These two components
are jointly optimized via a dual-loss objective, which forms a soft boundary
that localizes unlearning while preserving unrelated knowledge under
representation superposition. Experimental results show that AS improves
performance preservation over the state-of-the-art unlearning methods,
achieving up to 15% higher accuracy on the ToFU benchmark and 10% on the TDEC
benchmark, while maintaining competitive hallucination-free unlearning
effectiveness. Compared to existing methods, AS demonstrates a superior balance
between unlearning effectiveness, generalization, and response reliability.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
chain of thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the current LLM reasoning paradigm
initiates thinking only after the entire input is available, which introduces
unnecessary latency and weakens attention to earlier information in dynamic
scenarios. Inspired by human cognition of thinking while reading, we first
design a \textit{\textbf{streaming thinking}} paradigm for LLMs, where
reasoning unfolds in the order of input and further adjusts its depth once
reading is complete. We instantiate this paradigm with
\textit{StreamingThinker}, a framework that enables LLMs to think while reading
through the integration of streaming CoT generation, streaming-constraint
training, and streaming parallel inference. Specifically, StreamingThinker
employs streaming reasoning units with quality control for CoT generation,
enforces order-preserving reasoning through streaming attention masks and
position encoding, and leverages parallel KV caches that decouple input
encoding from reasoning generation, thereby ensuring alignment and enabling
true concurrency. We evaluate StreamingThinker on the Qwen3 model family across
math reasoning, logical reasoning, and context-based QA reasoning tasks.
Experimental results show that the StreamingThinker preserves performance
comparable to batch thinking, while yielding an 80\% reduction in token waiting
before the onset of reasoning and a more than 60\% reduction in time-level
latency for producing the final answer, demonstrating the effectiveness of the
streaming paradigm for LLM reasoning. Code will be released at

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent advances in video diffusion models have significantly enhanced
text-to-video generation, particularly through alignment tuning using reward
models trained on human preferences. While these methods improve visual
quality, they can unintentionally encode and amplify social biases. To
systematically trace how such biases evolve throughout the alignment pipeline,
we introduce VideoBiasEval, a comprehensive diagnostic framework for evaluating
social representation in video generation. Grounded in established social bias
taxonomies, VideoBiasEval employs an event-based prompting strategy to
disentangle semantic content (actions and contexts) from actor attributes
(gender and ethnicity). It further introduces multi-granular metrics to
evaluate (1) overall ethnicity bias, (2) gender bias conditioned on ethnicity,
(3) distributional shifts in social attributes across model variants, and (4)
the temporal persistence of bias within videos. Using this framework, we
conduct the first end-to-end analysis connecting biases in human preference
datasets, their amplification in reward models, and their propagation through
alignment-tuned video diffusion models. Our results reveal that alignment
tuning not only strengthens representational biases but also makes them
temporally stable, producing smoother yet more stereotyped portrayals. These
findings highlight the need for bias-aware evaluation and mitigation throughout
the alignment process to ensure fair and socially responsible video generation.

Abstract: News media often shape the public mood not only by what they report but by
how they frame it. The same event can appear calm in one outlet and alarming in
another, reflecting subtle emotional bias in reporting. Negative or emotionally
charged headlines tend to attract more attention and spread faster, which in
turn encourages outlets to frame stories in ways that provoke stronger
reactions. This research explores that tendency through large-scale emotion
analysis of Bengali news. Using zero-shot inference with Gemma-3 4B, we
analyzed 300000 Bengali news headlines and their content to identify the
dominant emotion and overall tone of each. The findings reveal a clear
dominance of negative emotions, particularly anger, fear, and disappointment,
and significant variation in how similar stories are emotionally portrayed
across outlets. Based on these insights, we propose design ideas for a
human-centered news aggregator that visualizes emotional cues and helps readers
recognize hidden affective framing in daily news.

Abstract: Large language models have exhibited impressive performance across a broad
range of downstream tasks in natural language processing. However, how a
language model predicts the next token and generates content is not generally
understandable by humans. Furthermore, these models often make errors in
prediction and reasoning, known as hallucinations. These errors underscore the
urgent need to better understand and interpret the intricate inner workings of
language models and how they generate predictive outputs. Motivated by this
gap, this paper investigates local explainability and mechanistic
interpretability within Transformer-based large language models to foster trust
in such models. In this regard, our paper aims to make three key contributions.
First, we present a review of local explainability and mechanistic
interpretability approaches and insights from relevant studies in the
literature. Furthermore, we describe experimental studies on explainability and
reasoning with large language models in two critical domains -- healthcare and
autonomous driving -- and analyze the trust implications of such explanations
for explanation receivers. Finally, we summarize current unaddressed issues in
the evolving landscape of LLM explainability and outline the opportunities,
critical challenges, and future directions toward generating human-aligned,
trustworthy LLM explanations.

Abstract: Taxonomies play a crucial role in helping researchers structure and navigate
knowledge in a hierarchical manner. They also form an important part in the
creation of comprehensive literature surveys. The existing approaches to
automatic survey generation do not compare the structure of the generated
surveys with those written by human experts. To address this gap, we present
our own method for automated taxonomy creation that can bridge the gap between
human-generated and automatically-created taxonomies. For this purpose, we
create the CS-TaxoBench benchmark which consists of 460 taxonomies that have
been extracted from human-written survey papers. We also include an additional
test set of 80 taxonomies curated from conference survey papers. We propose
TaxoAlign, a three-phase topic-based instruction-guided method for scholarly
taxonomy generation. Additionally, we propose a stringent automated evaluation
framework that measures the structural alignment and semantic coherence of
automatically generated taxonomies in comparison to those created by human
experts. We evaluate our method and various baselines on CS-TaxoBench, using
both automated evaluation metrics and human evaluation studies. The results
show that TaxoAlign consistently surpasses the baselines on nearly all metrics.

Abstract: Antisocial behavior (ASB) on social media -- including hate speech,

societal well-being. Prior research has focused largely on networks such as X
and Reddit, while \textit{multi-party conversational settings} remain
underexplored due to limited data. To address this gap, we use
\textit{CyberAgressionAdo-Large}, a French open-access dataset simulating ASB
in multi-party conversations, and evaluate three tasks: \textit{abuse
detection}, \textit{bullying behavior analysis}, and \textit{bullying
peer-group identification}. We benchmark six text-based and eight graph-based
\textit{representation-learning methods}, analyzing lexical cues, interactional
dynamics, and their multimodal fusion. Results show that multimodal models
outperform unimodal baselines. The late fusion model \texttt{mBERT + WD-SGCN}
achieves the best overall results, with top performance on abuse detection
(0.718) and competitive scores on peer-group identification (0.286) and
bullying analysis (0.606). Error analysis highlights its effectiveness in
handling nuanced ASB phenomena such as implicit aggression, role transitions,
and context-dependent hostility.

Abstract: Instruction-tuned large language models (IT-LLMs) exhibit strong zero-shot
reasoning, yet their ability to execute simple, self-contained instructions
remains underexplored, despite this being foundational to complex
instruction-following. We evaluate 20 IT-LLMs on modified MMLU and MMLU-Pro
benchmarks, by systematically varying the format of option labels (alphabetic,
numeric, Roman) while keeping their meaning identical under four paradigms,
namely: (1) With explicit instructions, label changes cause large performance
shifts (e.g., -30.45\% for Roman vs. numeric), revealing instruction-format
bias. (2) Without instructions, performance drops further (up to -10.84\%) and
label sensitivity intensifies, underscoring the role of explicit guidance. (3)
When option contents are removed, models fail random-choice baselines except
with numeric labels, suggesting weak adherence to atomic directives. (4)
Three-shot exemplars yield no significant gains in robustness or fidelity, and
generation analyses show persistent label errors, especially for non-numeric
formats. Across model sizes, larger LLMs achieve higher accuracy but remain
inconsistent in instruction adherence. These results expose the insufficiencies
of current instruction-tuning paradigms and highlight the need for evaluation
methods and training strategies that explicitly target atomic
instruction-following.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming education by answering
questions, explaining complex concepts, and generating content across a wide
range of subjects. Despite strong performance on academic benchmarks, they
often fail to tailor responses to students' grade levels. This is a critical
need in K-12 education, where age-appropriate vocabulary and explanation are
essential for effective learning. Existing models frequently produce outputs
that are too advanced or vague for younger learners, and there are no
standardized benchmarks to evaluate their ability to adjust across cognitive
and developmental stages. To address this gap, we introduce EduAdapt, a
benchmark of nearly 48k grade-labeled QA pairs across nine science subjects,
spanning Grades 1-12 and grouped into four grade levels. We evaluate a diverse
set of open-source LLMs on EduAdapt and find that while larger models generally
perform better, they still struggle with generating suitable responses for
early-grade students (Grades 1-5). Our work presents the first dataset and
evaluation framework for assessing grade-level adaptability in LLMs, aiming to
foster more developmentally aligned educational AI systems through better

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) presents a rich and structurally unique

supervised fine-tuning, they often face limitations in alignment, data quality,
and evaluation consistency. In this study, we introduce Ladder-base, the first
TCM-focused LLM trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a
reinforcement learning method that improves reasoning and factual consistency
by optimizing response selection based on intra-group comparisons. Ladder-base
is built upon the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct foundation model and trained exclusively
on the textual subset of the TCM-Ladder benchmark, using 80 percent of the data
for training and the remaining 20 percent split evenly between validation and
test sets. Through standardized evaluation, Ladder-base demonstrates superior
performance across multiple reasoning metrics when compared to both
state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs such as GPT-4, Gemini 2.5, Claude 3, and
Qwen3 and domain-specific TCM models including BenTsao, HuatuoGPT2, and
Zhongjing. These findings suggest that GRPO provides an effective and efficient
strategy for aligning LLMs with expert-level reasoning in traditional medical
domains and supports the development of trustworthy and clinically grounded TCM

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), with a history spanning over two
millennia, plays a role in global healthcare. However, applying large language
models (LLMs) to TCM remains challenging due to its reliance on holistic
reasoning, implicit logic, and multimodal diagnostic cues. Existing TCM-domain
LLMs have made progress in text-based understanding but lack multimodal
integration, interpretability, and clinical applicability. To address these
limitations, we developed BenCao, a ChatGPT-based multimodal assistant for TCM,
integrating structured knowledge bases, diagnostic data, and expert feedback
refinement. BenCao was trained through natural language instruction tuning
rather than parameter retraining, aligning with expert-level reasoning and
ethical norms specific to TCM. The system incorporates a comprehensive
knowledge base of over 1,000 classical and modern texts, a scenario-based
instruction framework for diverse interactions, a chain-of-thought simulation
mechanism for interpretable reasoning, and a feedback refinement process
involving licensed TCM practitioners. BenCao connects to external APIs for
tongue-image classification and multimodal database retrieval, enabling dynamic
access to diagnostic resources. In evaluations across single-choice question
benchmarks and multimodal classification tasks, BenCao achieved superior
accuracy to general-domain and TCM-domain models, particularly in diagnostics,
herb recognition, and constitution classification. The model was deployed as an
interactive application on the OpenAI GPTs Store, accessed by nearly 1,000
users globally as of October 2025. This study demonstrates the feasibility of
developing a TCM-domain LLM through natural language-based instruction tuning
and multimodal integration, offering a practical framework for aligning
generative AI with traditional medical reasoning and a scalable pathway for
real-world deployment.

Abstract: The "alignment tax" of post-training is typically framed as a drop in task
accuracy. We show it also involves a severe loss of calibration, making models
overconfident, less reliable, and model outputs less diverse. We show that this
trade-off can be navigated effectively via a simple post-hoc intervention:
interpolating between a model's weights before and after alignment. Crucially,
this is not a strict trade-off. We find that the process consistently reveals
Pareto-optimal interpolations - models that improve accuracy beyond both
parents while substantially recovering the calibration lost during alignment.
Our work demonstrates that simple model merging provides a computationally
efficient method for mitigating the full scope of the alignment tax, yielding
models that are more capable and more reliable.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) trains large language models to
autonomously call tools during reasoning, with search as the most common
application. These models excel at multi-step reasoning tasks, but their safety
properties are not well understood. In this study, we show that RL-trained
search models inherit refusal from instruction tuning and often deflect harmful
requests by turning them into safe queries. However, this safety is fragile.
Two simple attacks, one that forces the model to begin response with search
(Search attack), another that encourages models to repeatedly search
(Multi-search attack), trigger cascades of harmful searches and answers. Across
two model families (Qwen, Llama) with both local and web search, these attacks
lower refusal rates by up to 60.0%, answer safety by 82.5%, and search-query
safety by 82.4%. The attacks succeed by triggering models to generate harmful,
request-mirroring search queries before they can generate the inherited refusal
tokens. This exposes a core weakness of current RL training: it rewards
continued generation of effective queries without accounting for their
harmfulness. As a result, RL search models have vulnerabilities that users can
easily exploit, making it urgent to develop safety-aware agentic RL pipelines

Abstract: The rapidly increasing volume of electronic health record (EHR) data
underscores a pressing need to unlock biomedical knowledge from unstructured
clinical texts to support advancements in data-driven clinical systems,
including patient diagnosis, disease progression monitoring, treatment effects
assessment, prediction of future clinical events, etc. While contextualized
language models have demonstrated impressive performance improvements for named
entity recognition (NER) systems in English corpora, there remains a scarcity
of research focused on clinical texts in low-resource languages. To bridge this
gap, our study aims to develop multiple deep contextual embedding models to
enhance clinical NER in the cardiology domain, as part of the BioASQ
MultiCardioNER shared task. We explore the effectiveness of different
monolingual and multilingual BERT-based models, trained on general domain text,
for extracting disease and medication mentions from clinical case reports
written in English, Spanish, and Italian. We achieved an F1-score of 77.88% on
Spanish Diseases Recognition (SDR), 92.09% on Spanish Medications Recognition
(SMR), 91.74% on English Medications Recognition (EMR), and 88.9% on Italian
Medications Recognition (IMR). These results outperform the mean and median F1
scores in the test leaderboard across all subtasks, with the mean/median values
being: 69.61%/75.66% for SDR, 81.22%/90.18% for SMR, 89.2%/88.96% for EMR, and
82.8%/87.76% for IMR.

Abstract: Idiomatic translation remains a significant challenge in machine translation,
especially for low resource languages such as Urdu, and has received limited
prior attention. To advance research in this area, we introduce the first
evaluation datasets for Urdu to English idiomatic translation, covering both
Native Urdu and Roman Urdu scripts and annotated with gold-standard English
equivalents. We evaluate multiple open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems on this task, focusing on their
ability to preserve idiomatic and cultural meaning. Automatic metrics including
BLEU, BERTScore, COMET, and XCOMET are used to assess translation quality. Our
findings indicate that prompt engineering enhances idiomatic translation
compared to direct translation, though performance differences among prompt
types are relatively minor. Moreover, cross script comparisons reveal that text
representation substantially affects translation quality, with Native Urdu
inputs producing more accurate idiomatic translations than Roman Urdu.

Abstract: Equitable access to reliable health information is vital when integrating AI
into healthcare. Yet, information quality varies across languages, raising
concerns about the reliability and consistency of multilingual Large Language
Models (LLMs). We systematically examine cross-lingual disparities in
pre-training source and factuality alignment in LLM answers for multilingual
healthcare Q&A across English, German, Turkish, Chinese (Mandarin), and
Italian. We (i) constructed Multilingual Wiki Health Care
(MultiWikiHealthCare), a multilingual dataset from Wikipedia; (ii) analyzed
cross-lingual healthcare coverage; (iii) assessed LLM response alignment with
these references; and (iv) conducted a case study on factual alignment through
the use of contextual information and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Our
findings reveal substantial cross-lingual disparities in both Wikipedia
coverage and LLM factual alignment. Across LLMs, responses align more with
English Wikipedia, even when the prompts are non-English. Providing contextual
excerpts from non-English Wikipedia at inference time effectively shifts
factual alignment toward culturally relevant knowledge. These results highlight
practical pathways for building more equitable, multilingual AI systems for
healthcare.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a promising approach
to scale Large Language Models (LLMs). MoE boosts the efficiency by activating
a subset of experts per token. Recent works show that fine-grained experts
substantially enriches the combinatorial flexibility of active experts and
enhances model expressiveness. However, such a design is fundamentally limited
by the layer-local routing mechanism: each layer is restricted to its own
expert pool. This requires a careful trade-off between expert dimensionality
and routing diversity given fixed parameter budgets. We describe ReXMoE, a
novel MoE architecture that improves routing beyond the existing layer-local
approaches by allowing routers to reuse experts across adjacent layers. ReXMoE
decouples expert dimensionality from per-layer budgets, enabling richer expert
combinations without sacrificing individual expert capacity or inflating
overall parameters. To this end, we propose a new progressive scaling routing
(PSR) strategy to gradually increase the candidate expert pool during training.
As a result, ReXMoE improves both language modeling and downstream task
performance. Extensive experiments on models ranging from 0.5B to 7B parameters
across different architectures demonstrate that ReXMoE consistently improves
performance under fixed architectural dimensions, confirming ReXMoE as new
design paradigm for parameter-efficient and scalable MoE-based LLMs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Detecting AI-involved text is essential for combating misinformation,
plagiarism, and academic misconduct. However, AI text generation includes
diverse collaborative processes (AI-written text edited by humans,
human-written text edited by AI, and AI-generated text refined by other AI),
where various or even new LLMs could be involved. Texts generated through these
varied processes exhibit complex characteristics, presenting significant
challenges for detection. Current methods model these processes rather crudely,
primarily employing binary classification (purely human vs. AI-involved) or
multi-classification (treating human-AI collaboration as a new class). We
observe that representations of texts generated through different processes
exhibit inherent clustering relationships. Therefore, we propose DETree, a
novel approach that models the relationships among different processes as a
Hierarchical Affinity Tree structure, and introduces a specialized loss
function that aligns text representations with this tree. To facilitate this
learning, we developed RealBench, a comprehensive benchmark dataset that
automatically incorporates a wide spectrum of hybrid texts produced through
various human-AI collaboration processes. Our method improves performance in
hybrid text detection tasks and significantly enhances robustness and
generalization in out-of-distribution scenarios, particularly in few-shot
learning conditions, further demonstrating the promise of training-based
approaches in OOD settings. Our code and dataset are available at
https://github.com/heyongxin233/DETree.

Abstract: With the rise of large language models (LLMs), LLM agents capable of
autonomous reasoning, planning, and executing complex tasks have become a
frontier in artificial intelligence. However, how to translate the research on
general agents into productivity that drives industry transformations remains a
significant challenge. To address this, this paper systematically reviews the
technologies, applications, and evaluation methods of industry agents based on
LLMs. Using an industry agent capability maturity framework, it outlines the
evolution of agents in industry applications, from "process execution systems"
to "adaptive social systems." First, we examine the three key technological
pillars that support the advancement of agent capabilities: Memory, Planning,
and Tool Use. We discuss how these technologies evolve from supporting simple
tasks in their early forms to enabling complex autonomous systems and
collective intelligence in more advanced forms. Then, we provide an overview of
the application of industry agents in real-world domains such as digital
engineering, scientific discovery, embodied intelligence, collaborative
business execution, and complex system simulation. Additionally, this paper
reviews the evaluation benchmarks and methods for both fundamental and
specialized capabilities, identifying the challenges existing evaluation
systems face regarding authenticity, safety, and industry specificity. Finally,
we focus on the practical challenges faced by industry agents, exploring their
capability boundaries, developmental potential, and governance issues in
various scenarios, while providing insights into future directions. By
combining technological evolution with industry practices, this review aims to
clarify the current state and offer a clear roadmap and theoretical foundation
for understanding and building the next generation of industry agents.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Long-form chain-of-thought reasoning has become a cornerstone of advanced
reasoning in large language models. While recent verification-refinement
frameworks have enabled proprietary models to solve Olympiad-level problems,
their effectiveness hinges on strong, reliable verification and correction
capabilities, which remain fragile in open-weight, smaller-scale models. This
work demonstrates that even with weak verification and refinement capabilities
on hard tasks, the reasoning limits of such models can be substantially
extended through a probabilistic paradigm we call Deep Self-Evolving Reasoning
(DSER). We conceptualize iterative reasoning as a Markov chain, where each step
represents a stochastic transition in the solution space. The key insight is
that convergence to a correct solution is guaranteed as long as the probability
of improvement marginally exceeds that of degradation. By running multiple
long-horizon, self-evolving processes in parallel, DSER amplifies these small
positive tendencies, enabling the model to asymptotically approach correct
answers. Empirically, we apply DSER to the DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B model. On
the challenging AIME 2024-2025 benchmark, DSER solves 5 out of 9 previously
unsolvable problems and boosts overall performance, enabling this compact model
to surpass the single-turn accuracy of its 600B-parameter teacher through
majority voting. Beyond its immediate utility for test-time scaling, the DSER
framework serves to diagnose the fundamental limitations of current open-weight
reasoners. By clearly delineating their shortcomings in self-verification,
refinement, and stability, our findings establish a clear research agenda for
developing next-generation models with powerful, intrinsic self-evolving
capabilities.

Abstract: While BERT is an effective method for learning monolingual sentence
embeddings for semantic similarity and embedding based transfer learning BERT
based cross-lingual sentence embeddings have yet to be explored. We
systematically investigate methods for learning multilingual sentence
embeddings by combining the best methods for learning monolingual and
cross-lingual representations including: masked language modeling (MLM),
translation language modeling (TLM), dual encoder translation ranking, and
additive margin softmax. We show that introducing a pre-trained multilingual
language model dramatically reduces the amount of parallel training data
required to achieve good performance by 80%. Composing the best of these
methods produces a model that achieves 83.7% bi-text retrieval accuracy over
112 languages on Tatoeba, well above the 65.5 achieved by LASER, while still
performing competitively on monolingual transfer learning benchmarks. Parallel
data mined from CommonCrawl using our best model is shown to train competitive
NMT models for en-zh and en-de. We publicly release our best multilingual
sentence embedding model for 109+ languages at https://tfhub.dev/google/LaBSE.

Abstract: Honesty alignment-the ability of large language models (LLMs) to recognize
their knowledge boundaries and express calibrated confidence-is essential for
trustworthy deployment. Existing methods either rely on training-free
confidence estimation (e.g., token probabilities, self-consistency) or
training-based calibration with correctness annotations. While effective,
achieving universal honesty alignment with training-based calibration requires
costly, large-scale labeling. To support annotation-efficient training, we
introduce Elicitation-Then-Calibration (EliCal), a two-stage framework that
first elicits internal confidence using inexpensive self-consistency
supervision, then calibrates this confidence with a small set of correctness
annotations. To support a large-scale study, we release HonestyBench, a
benchmark covering ten free-form QA datasets with 560k training and 70k
evaluation instances annotated with correctness and self-consistency signals.
Experiments show that EliCal achieves near-optimal alignment with only 1k
correctness annotations (0.18% of full supervision) and better alignment
performance on unseen MMLU tasks than the calibration-only baseline, offering a
scalable solution toward universal honesty alignment in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) simulations of human behavior have the potential
to revolutionize the social and behavioral sciences, if and only if they
faithfully reflect real human behaviors. Current evaluations are fragmented,
based on bespoke tasks and metrics, creating a patchwork of incomparable
results. To address this, we introduce SimBench, the first large-scale,
standardized benchmark for a robust, reproducible science of LLM simulation. By
unifying 20 diverse datasets covering tasks from moral decision-making to
economic choice across a large global participant pool, SimBench provides the
necessary foundation to ask fundamental questions about when, how, and why LLM
simulations succeed or fail. We show that, while even the best LLMs today have
limited simulation ability (score: 40.80/100), performance scales log-linearly
with model size. Simulation performance is not improved by increased
inference-time compute. We demonstrate an alignment-simulation trade-off:
instruction-tuning improves performance on low-entropy (consensus) questions
but degrades it on high-entropy (diverse) ones. Models particularly struggle
when simulating specific demographic groups. Finally, we demonstrate that
simulation ability correlates most strongly with deep, knowledge-intensive
reasoning (MMLU-Pro, r=0.939). By making progress measurable, we aim to
accelerate the development of more faithful LLM simulators.

Abstract: Predicting cancer treatment outcomes requires models that are both accurate
and interpretable, particularly in the presence of heterogeneous clinical data.
While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in biomedical
NLP, they often lack structured reasoning capabilities critical for high-stakes
decision support. We present a unified, multi-task learning framework that
aligns autoregressive LLMs with clinical reasoning for outcome prediction on
the MSK-CHORD dataset. Our models are trained to jointly perform binary
survival classification, continuous survival time regression, and natural
language rationale generation. We evaluate three alignment strategies: (1)
standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT), (2) SFT with Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting to elicit step-by-step reasoning, and (3) Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning method that aligns model outputs
to expert-derived reasoning trajectories. Experiments with LLaMa3-8B and
Med42-8B backbones demonstrate that CoT prompting improves F1 by +6.0 and
reduces MAE by 12%, while GRPO achieves state-of-the-art interpretability and
predictive performance across BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore. We further show that
existing biomedical LLMs often fail to produce valid reasoning traces due to
architectural constraints. Our findings underscore the importance of
reasoning-aware alignment in multi-task clinical modeling and set a new
benchmark for interpretable, trustworthy LLMs in precision oncology.

Abstract: Language models are often evaluated with scalar metrics like accuracy, but
such measures fail to capture how models internally represent ambiguity,
especially when human annotators disagree. We propose a topological perspective
to analyze how fine-tuned models encode ambiguity and more generally instances.
  Applied to RoBERTa-Large on the MD-Offense dataset, Mapper, a tool from
topological data analysis, reveals that fine-tuning restructures embedding
space into modular, non-convex regions aligned with model predictions, even for
highly ambiguous cases. Over $98\%$ of connected components exhibit $\geq 90\%$
prediction purity, yet alignment with ground-truth labels drops in ambiguous
data, surfacing a hidden tension between structural confidence and label
uncertainty.
  Unlike traditional tools such as PCA or UMAP, Mapper captures this geometry
directly uncovering decision regions, boundary collapses, and overconfident
clusters. Our findings position Mapper as a powerful diagnostic tool for
understanding how models resolve ambiguity. Beyond visualization, it also
enables topological metrics that may inform proactive modeling strategies in
subjective NLP tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often experience language confusion, which is
the unintended mixing of languages during text generation. Current solutions to
this problem either necessitate model retraining or cannot differentiate
between harmful confusion and acceptable code-switching. This paper introduces
the Language Confusion Gate (LCG), a lightweight, plug-in solution that filters
tokens during decoding without altering the base LLM. The LCG is trained using
norm-adjusted self-distillation to predict appropriate language families and
apply masking only when needed. Our method is based on the findings that
language confusion is infrequent, correct-language tokens are usually among the
top predictions, and output token embedding norms are larger for high-resource
languages, which biases sampling. When evaluated across various models,
including Qwen3, GPT-OSS, Gemma3, Llama3.1, LCG decreases language confusion
significantly, often by an order of magnitude, without negatively impacting
task performance. Code is available at

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) are increasingly being applied to
code-related tasks. Although PLMs have achieved good results, they do not take
into account potential high-order data correlations within the code. We propose
three types of high-order correlations in code tokens, i.e. abstract syntax
tree family correlation, lexical correlation, and line correlation. We design a
tokens and hyperedges generator to capture these high-order data correlations.
We improve the architecture of hypergraph neural networks and combine it with
adapter tuning to propose a novel hypergraph-based adapter (HGAdapter) to
fine-tune PLMs. HGAdapter can encode high-order data correlations and is
allowed to be inserted into various PLMs to enhance performance. Experiments
were conducted on several public datasets, including six languages of code
summarization and code clone detection tasks. Our methods improved the
performance of PLMs in datasets to varying degrees. Experimental results
validate the introduction of high-order data correlations that contribute to
improved effectiveness.

Abstract: Legal reasoning is a fundamental component of legal analysis and
decision-making. Existing computational approaches to legal reasoning
predominantly rely on generic reasoning frameworks such as syllogism and IRAC,
which do not comprehensively examine the nuanced processes that underpin legal
reasoning. Moreover, current research has largely focused on criminal cases,
with insufficient modeling for civil cases. In this work, we present a novel
framework for explicitly modeling legal reasoning in the analysis of Chinese
tort-related civil cases. We first operationalize the legal reasoning processes
used in tort analysis into the LawChain framework. LawChain is a three-module
reasoning framework, with each module consisting of multiple finer-grained
sub-steps. Informed by the LawChain framework, we introduce the task of tort
legal reasoning and construct an evaluation benchmark, LawChain$_{eval}$, to
systematically assess the critical steps within analytical reasoning chains for
tort analysis. Leveraging this benchmark, we evaluate state-of-the-art large
language models for their legal reasoning ability in civil tort contexts. Our
results indicate that current models still fall short in accurately handling
crucial elements of tort legal reasoning. Furthermore, we introduce several
baseline approaches that explicitly incorporate LawChain-style reasoning
through prompting or post-training. We conduct further experiments on
additional legal analysis tasks, such as Legal Named-Entity Recognition and
Criminal Damages Calculation, to verify the generalizability of these
baselines. The proposed baseline approaches achieve significant improvements in
tort-related legal reasoning and generalize well to related legal analysis
tasks, thus demonstrating the value of explicitly modeling legal reasoning
chains to enhance the reasoning capabilities of language models.

Abstract: Large language models may encode sensitive information or outdated knowledge
that needs to be removed, to ensure responsible and compliant model responses.
Unlearning has emerged as an efficient alternative to full retraining, aiming
to remove specific knowledge while preserving overall model utility. Existing
evaluations of unlearning methods focus on (1) the extent of forgetting of the
target knowledge (forget set) and (2) maintaining performance on the retain set
(i.e., utility). However, these evaluations overlook an important usability
aspect: users may still want the model to leverage the removed information if
it is re-introduced in the prompt. In a systematic evaluation of six
state-of-the-art unlearning methods, we find that they consistently impair such
contextual utility. To address this, we augment unlearning objectives with a
plug-in term that preserves the model's ability to use forgotten knowledge when
it is present in context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
restores contextual utility to near original levels while still maintaining
effective forgetting and retain-set utility.

Abstract: Large Language Models have achieved strong performance on reasoning tasks,
solving competition-level coding and math problems. However, their scalability
is limited by human-labeled datasets and the lack of large-scale, challenging
coding problem training data. Existing competitive coding datasets contain only
thousands to tens of thousands of problems. Previous synthetic data generation
methods rely on either augmenting existing instruction datasets or selecting
challenging problems from human-labeled data. In this paper, we propose QueST,
a novel framework which combines difficulty-aware graph sampling and
difficulty-aware rejection fine-tuning that directly optimizes specialized
generators to create challenging coding problems. Our trained generators
demonstrate superior capability compared to even GPT-4o at creating challenging
problems that benefit downstream performance. We leverage QueST to generate
large-scale synthetic coding problems, which we then use to distill from strong
teacher models with long chain-of-thought or to conduct reinforcement learning
for smaller models, proving effective in both scenarios. Our distillation
experiments demonstrate significant performance gains. Specifically, after
fine-tuning Qwen3-8B-base on 100K difficult problems generated by QueST, we
surpass the performance of the original Qwen3-8B on LiveCodeBench. With an
additional 112K examples (i.e., 28K human-written problems paired with multiple
synthetic solutions), our 8B model matches the performance of the much larger
DeepSeek-R1-671B. These findings indicate that generating complex problems via
QueST offers an effective and scalable approach to advancing the frontiers of
competitive coding and reasoning for large language models.

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a critical task that requires substantial
annotated data, making it challenging in low-resource scenarios where label
acquisition is expensive. While zero-shot and instruction-tuned approaches have
made progress, they often fail to generalize to domain-specific entities and do
not effectively utilize limited available data. We present a lightweight
few-shot NER framework that addresses these challenges through two key
innovations: (1) a new instruction tuning template with a simplified output
format that combines principles from prior IT approaches to leverage the large
context window of recent state-of-the-art LLMs; (2) introducing a strategic
data augmentation technique that preserves entity information while
paraphrasing the surrounding context, thereby expanding our training data
without compromising semantic relationships. Experiments on benchmark datasets
show that our method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models
on few-shot and zero-shot tasks, with our few-shot approach attaining an
average F1 score of 80.1 on the CrossNER datasets. Models trained with our
paraphrasing approach show consistent improvements in F1 scores of up to 17
points over baseline versions, offering a promising solution for groups with
limited NER training data and compute power.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable performance in
long-context understanding. However, current long-context LLM benchmarks are
limited by rigid context length, labor-intensive annotation, and the pressing
challenge of label leakage issues during LLM training. Therefore, we propose
\textsc{AcademicEval}, a live benchmark for evaluating LLMs over long-context
generation tasks. \textsc{AcademicEval} adopts papers on arXiv to introduce
several academic writing tasks with long-context inputs, \textit{i.e.},
\textsc{Title}, \textsc{Abstract}, \textsc{Introduction}, and \textsc{Related
Work}, which cover a wide range of abstraction levels and require no manual
labeling. Moreover, \textsc{AcademicEval} integrates high-quality and
expert-curated few-shot demonstrations from a collected co-author graph to
enable flexible context length. Especially, \textsc{AcademicEval} features an
efficient live evaluation, ensuring no label leakage. We conduct a holistic
evaluation on \textsc{AcademicEval}, and the results illustrate that LLMs
perform poorly on tasks with hierarchical abstraction levels and tend to
struggle with long few-shot demonstrations, highlighting the challenge of our
benchmark. Through experimental analysis, we also reveal some insights for
enhancing LLMs' long-context modeling capabilities. Code is available at

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Language models often generate factually incorrect information unsupported by
their training data, a phenomenon known as extrinsic hallucination. Existing
mitigation approaches often degrade performance on open-ended generation and
downstream tasks, limiting their practical utility. We propose an online
reinforcement learning method using a novel binary retrieval-augmented reward
(RAR) to address this tradeoff. Unlike continuous reward schemes, our approach
assigns a reward of one only when the model's output is entirely factually
correct, and zero otherwise. We evaluate our method on Qwen3 reasoning models
across diverse tasks. For open-ended generation, binary RAR achieves a 39.3%
reduction in hallucination rates, substantially outperforming both supervised
training and continuous-reward RL baselines. In short-form question answering,
the model learns calibrated abstention, strategically outputting "I don't know"
when faced with insufficient parametric knowledge. This yields 44.4% and 21.7%
fewer incorrect answers on PopQA and GPQA, respectively. Crucially, these
factuality gains come without performance degradation on instruction following,
math, or code, whereas continuous-reward RL, despite improving factuality,
induces quality regressions.

Abstract: Medical Large language models achieve strong scores on standard benchmarks;
however, the transfer of those results to safe and reliable performance in
clinical workflows remains a challenge. This survey reframes evaluation through
a levels-of-autonomy lens (L0-L3), spanning informational tools, information
transformation and aggregation, decision support, and supervised agents. We
align existing benchmarks and metrics with the actions permitted at each level
and their associated risks, making the evaluation targets explicit. This
motivates a level-conditioned blueprint for selecting metrics, assembling
evidence, and reporting claims, alongside directions that link evaluation to
oversight. By centering autonomy, the survey moves the field beyond score-based
claims toward credible, risk-aware evidence for real clinical use.

Abstract: Finetuning specialized generative evaluators has emerged as a popular
paradigm to meet the increasing demand for scalable evaluation during both
training and test-time. However, recent work has largely focused on applying
new methodology, such as reinforcement learning (RL), to training evaluators,
shying away from large-scale, data-driven development. In this work, we focus
on data scaling, curating a set of 2.5M samples spanning five unique evaluation
tasks (pairwise, step-level, reference-free and reference-based verification,
and single rating) and multiple domains focused on reasoning evaluation. With
our data, we train Foundational Automatic Reasoning Evaluators (FARE), a family
of 8B and 20B (with 3.6B active) parameter evaluators, with a simple iterative
rejection-sampling supervised finetuning (SFT) approach. FARE-8B challenges
larger specialized RL-trained evaluators and FARE-20B sets the new standard for
open-source evaluators, surpassing specialized 70B+ evaluators. Beyond static
benchmarks, we evaluate FARE in real-world tasks: As inference-time rerankers,
FARE-20B achieves near-oracle performance on MATH. As verifiers in RL training,
FARE improves the downstream RL-trained model performance by up to 14.1% vs.
string-matching verifiers. When initialized from FARE, a continually-finetuned
FARE-Code outperforms gpt-oss-20B by 65% on evaluating test-case quality.

Abstract: Replicating AI research is a crucial yet challenging task for large language
model (LLM) agents. Existing approaches often struggle to generate executable
code, primarily due to insufficient background knowledge and the limitations of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods, which fail to capture latent
technical details hidden in referenced papers. Furthermore, previous approaches
tend to overlook valuable implementation-level code signals and lack structured
knowledge representations that support multi-granular retrieval and reuse. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Executable Knowledge Graphs (xKG), a
modular and pluggable knowledge base that automatically integrates technical
insights, code snippets, and domain-specific knowledge extracted from
scientific literature. When integrated into three agent frameworks with two
different LLMs, xKG shows substantial performance gains (10.9% with o3-mini) on
PaperBench, demonstrating its effectiveness as a general and extensible
solution for automated AI research replication. Code will released at

autonomous agents show promise, they often struggle with domain-specific
nuances, intent alignment, and enterprise integration. We present Enterprise
Deep Research (EDR), a multi-agent system that integrates (1) a Master Planning
Agent for adaptive query decomposition, (2) four specialized search agents
(General, Academic, GitHub, LinkedIn), (3) an extensible MCP-based tool
ecosystem supporting NL2SQL, file analysis, and enterprise workflows, (4) a
Visualization Agent for data-driven insights, and (5) a reflection mechanism
that detects knowledge gaps and updates research direction with optional
human-in-the-loop steering guidance. These components enable automated report
generation, real-time streaming, and seamless enterprise deployment, as
validated on internal datasets. On open-ended benchmarks including DeepResearch

Abstract: Foodborne illnesses are gastrointestinal conditions caused by consuming
contaminated food. Restaurants are critical venues to investigate outbreaks
because they share sourcing, preparation, and distribution of foods. Public
reporting of illness via formal channels is limited, whereas social media
platforms host abundant user-generated content that can provide timely public
health signals. This paper analyzes signals from Yelp reviews produced by a
Hierarchical Sigmoid Attention Network (HSAN) classifier and compares them with
official restaurant inspection outcomes issued by the New York City Department
of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH) in 2023. We evaluate correlations at
the Census tract level, compare distributions of HSAN scores by prevalence of
C-graded restaurants, and map spatial patterns across NYC. We find minimal
correlation between HSAN signals and inspection scores at the tract level and
no significant differences by number of C-graded restaurants. We discuss
implications and outline next steps toward address-level analyses.

Abstract: We investigate the exploitation of both lexical and neural relevance signals
for ad-hoc passage retrieval. Our exploration involves a large-scale training
dataset in which dense neural representations of MS-MARCO queries and passages
are complemented and integrated with 253 hand-crafted lexical features
extracted from the same corpus. Blending of the relevance signals from the two
different groups of features is learned by a classical Learning-to-Rank (LTR)
model based on a forest of decision trees. To evaluate our solution, we employ
a pipelined architecture where a dense neural retriever serves as the first
stage and performs a nearest-neighbor search over the neural representations of
the documents. Our LTR model acts instead as the second stage that re-ranks the
set of candidates retrieved by the first stage to enhance effectiveness. The
results of reproducible experiments conducted with state-of-the-art dense
retrievers on publicly available resources show that the proposed solution
significantly enhances the end-to-end ranking performance while relatively
minimally impacting efficiency. Specifically, we achieve a boost in nDCG@10 of
up to 11% with an increase in average query latency of only 4.3%. This confirms
the advantage of seamlessly combining two distinct families of signals that
mutually contribute to retrieval effectiveness.

Abstract: Reviewer recommendation is a critical task for enhancing the efficiency of
academic publishing workflows. However, research in this area has been
persistently hindered by the lack of high-quality benchmark datasets, which are
often limited in scale, disciplinary scope, and comparative analyses of
different methodologies. To address this gap, we introduce FRONTIER-RevRec, a
large-scale dataset constructed from authentic peer review records (2007-2025)
from the Frontiers open-access publishing platform
https://www.frontiersin.org/. The dataset contains 177941 distinct reviewers
and 478379 papers across 209 journals spanning multiple disciplines including
clinical medicine, biology, psychology, engineering, and social sciences. Our
comprehensive evaluation on this dataset reveals that content-based methods
significantly outperform collaborative filtering. This finding is explained by
our structural analysis, which uncovers fundamental differences between
academic recommendation and commercial domains. Notably, approaches leveraging
language models are particularly effective at capturing the semantic alignment
between a paper's content and a reviewer's expertise. Furthermore, our
experiments identify optimal aggregation strategies to enhance the
recommendation pipeline. FRONTIER-RevRec is intended to serve as a
comprehensive benchmark to advance research in reviewer recommendation and
facilitate the development of more effective academic peer review systems. The

Abstract: Question answering in temporal knowledge graphs requires retrieval that is
both time-consistent and efficient. Existing RAG methods are largely semantic
and typically neglect explicit temporal constraints, which leads to
time-inconsistent answers and inflated token usage. We propose STAR-RAG, a
temporal GraphRAG framework that relies on two key ideas: building a
time-aligned rule graph and conducting propagation on this graph to narrow the
search space and prioritize semantically relevant, time-consistent evidence.
This design enforces temporal proximity during retrieval, reduces the candidate
set of retrieval results, and lowers token consumption without sacrificing
accuracy. Compared with existing temporal RAG approaches, STAR-RAG eliminates
the need for heavy model training and fine-tuning, thereby reducing
computational cost and significantly simplifying deployment.Extensive
experiments on real-world temporal KG datasets show that our method achieves
improved answer accuracy while consuming fewer tokens than strong GraphRAG
baselines.

Abstract: This paper investigates the usage of FPGA devices for energy-efficient exact
kNN search in high-dimension latent spaces. This work intercepts a relevant
trend that tries to support the increasing popularity of learned
representations based on neural encoder models by making their large-scale
adoption greener and more inclusive. The paper proposes two different
energy-efficient solutions adopting the same FPGA low-level configuration. The
first solution maximizes system throughput by processing the queries of a batch
in parallel over a streamed dataset not fitting into the FPGA memory. The
second minimizes latency by processing each kNN incoming query in parallel over
an in-memory dataset. Reproducible experiments on publicly available image and
text datasets show that our solution outperforms state-of-the-art CPU-based
competitors regarding throughput, latency, and energy consumption.
Specifically, experiments show that the proposed FPGA solutions achieve the
best throughput in terms of queries per second and the best-observed latency
with scale-up factors of up to 16.6X. Similar considerations can be made
regarding energy efficiency, where results show that our solutions can achieve
up to 11.9X energy saving w.r.t. strong CPU-based competitors.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The whole-page reranking plays a critical role in shaping the user experience
of search engines, which integrates retrieval results from multiple modalities,
such as documents, images, videos, and LLM outputs. Existing methods mainly
rely on large-scale human-annotated data, which is costly to obtain and
time-consuming. This is because whole-page annotation is far more complex than
single-modal: it requires assessing the entire result page while accounting for
cross-modal relevance differences. Thus, how to improve whole-page reranking
performance while reducing annotation costs is still a key challenge in
optimizing search engine result pages(SERP). In this paper, we propose SMAR, a
novel whole-page reranking framework that leverages strong Single-modal rankers
to guide Modal-wise relevance Alignment for effective Reranking, using only
limited whole-page annotation to outperform fully-annotated reranking models.
Specifically, high-quality single-modal rankers are first trained on data
specific to their respective modalities. Then, for each query, we select a
subset of their outputs to construct candidate pages and perform human
annotation at the page level. Finally, we train the whole-page reranker using
these limited annotations and enforcing consistency with single-modal
preferences to maintain ranking quality within each modality. Experiments on
the Qilin and Baidu datasets demonstrate that SMAR reduces annotation costs by
about 70-90\% while achieving significant ranking improvements compared to
baselines. Further offline and online A/B testing on Baidu APPs also shows
notable gains in standard ranking metrics as well as user experience
indicators, fully validating the effectiveness and practical value of our
approach in real-world search scenarios.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Generative Recommendation (GR) models treat a user's interaction history as a
sequence to be autoregressively predicted. When both items and actions (e.g.,
watch time, purchase, comment) are modeled, the layout-the ordering and
visibility of item/action tokens-critically determines what information the
model can use and how it generalizes. We present a unified study of token
layouts for GR grounded in first principles: (P1) maximize item/action signal
in both input/output space, (P2) preserve the conditioning relationship "action
given item" and (P3) no information leakage.
  While interleaved layout (where item and action occupy separate tokens)
naturally satisfies these principles, it also bloats sequence length with
larger training/inference cost. On the non-interleaved front, we design a novel
and effective approach, Lagged Action Conditioning (LAC), which appears strange
on the surface but aligns well with the design principles to yield strong
accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on public datasets and large-scale
production logs evaluate different layout options and empirically verifies the
design principles. Our proposed non-interleaved method, LAC, achieves
competitive or superior quality at substantially lower FLOPs than interleaving.
Our findings offer actionable guidance for assembling GR systems that are both
accurate and efficient.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Search-based recommendation is one of the most critical application scenarios
in e-commerce platforms. Users' complex search contexts--such as spatiotemporal
factors, historical interactions, and current query's information--constitute
an essential part of their decision-making, reflecting implicit preferences
that complement explicit query terms. Modeling such rich contextual signals and
their intricate associations with candidate items remains a key challenge.
Although numerous efforts have been devoted to building more effective search
methods, existing approaches still show limitations in integrating contextual
information, which hinders their ability to fully capture user intent.
  To address these challenges, we propose a context-aware reasoning-enhanced
generative search framework for better \textbf{understanding the complicated
context}. Specifically, the framework first unifies heterogeneous user and item
contexts into textual representations or text-based semantic identifiers and
aligns them. To overcome the lack of explicit reasoning trajectories, we
introduce a self-evolving post-training paradigm that iteratively combines
supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to progressively enhance the
model's reasoning capability. In addition, we identify potential biases in
existing RL algorithms when applied to search scenarios and present a debiased
variant of GRPO to improve ranking performance. Extensive experiments on search
log data collected from a real-world e-commerce platform demonstrate that our
approach achieves superior performance compared with strong baselines,
validating its effectiveness for search-based recommendation.

extend it to Explainable DSE that requires identifying the metadata and content
fields of a dataset that indicate its relevance to the query and similarity to
the target datasets. To facilitate this research, we construct DSEBench, a test
collection that provides high-quality dataset- and field-level annotations to
enable the evaluation of explainable DSE. We also employ a large language model
to generate numerous annotations to be used for training. We establish
extensive baselines on DSEBench by adapting and evaluating a variety of sparse,
dense, and LLM-based retrieval, reranking, and explanation methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative
sequential recommendation, which typically generate next items to recommend
guided by user interaction histories with a multi-step denoising process.
However, the multi-step process relies on discrete approximations, introducing
discretization error that creates a trade-off between computational efficiency
and recommendation effectiveness. To address this trade-off, we propose TA-Rec,
a two-stage framework that achieves one-step generation by smoothing the
denoising function during pretraining while alleviating trajectory deviation by
aligning with user preferences during fine-tuning. Specifically, to improve the
efficiency without sacrificing the recommendation performance, TA-Rec pretrains
the denoising model with Temporal Consistency Regularization (TCR), enforcing
the consistency between the denoising results across adjacent steps. Thus, we
can smooth the denoising function to map the noise as oracle items in one step
with bounded error. To further enhance effectiveness, TA-Rec introduces
Adaptive Preference Alignment (APA) that aligns the denoising process with user
preference adaptively based on preference pair similarity and timesteps.
Extensive experiments prove that TA-Rec's two-stage objective effectively
mitigates the discretization errors-induced trade-off, enhancing both
efficiency and effectiveness of diffusion-based recommenders.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as promising zero-shot rankers, but
their performance is highly sensitive to prompt formulation. In particular,
role-play prompts, where the model is assigned a functional role or identity,
often give more robust and accurate relevance rankings. However, the mechanisms
and diversity of role-play effects remain underexplored, limiting both
effective use and interpretability. In this work, we systematically examine how
role-play variations influence zero-shot LLM rankers. We employ causal
intervention techniques from mechanistic interpretability to trace how
role-play information shapes relevance judgments in LLMs. Our analysis reveals
that (1) careful formulation of role descriptions have a large effect on the
ranking quality of the LLM; (2) role-play signals are predominantly encoded in
early layers and communicate with task instructions in middle layers, while
receiving limited interaction with query or document representations.
Specifically, we identify a group of attention heads that encode information
critical for role-conditioned relevance. These findings not only shed light on
the inner workings of role-play in LLM ranking but also offer guidance for
designing more effective prompts in IR and beyond, pointing toward broader
opportunities for leveraging role-play in zero-shot applications.
