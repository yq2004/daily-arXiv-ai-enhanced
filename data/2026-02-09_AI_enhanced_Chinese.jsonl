Yet, despite its empirical success, they are primarily built on a \"single-turn\" formulation where each query-target pair is treated as an independent data point. This paradigm leads to computational inefficiency when scaling, as it requires a separate forward pass for each pair and overlooks potential contextual relationships between multiple queries that can relate to the same context. In this work, we introduce Multi-Turn Contrastive Learning (MuCo), a dialogue-inspired framework that revisits this process. MuCo leverages the conversational nature of MLLMs to process multiple, related query-target pairs associated with a single image within a single forward pass. This allows us to extract a set of multiple query and target embeddings simultaneously, conditioned on a shared context representation, amplifying the effective batch size and overall training efficiency. Experiments exhibit MuCo with a newly curated 5M multimodal multi-turn dataset (M3T), which yields state-of-the-art retrieval performance on MMEB and M-BEIR benchmarks, while markedly enhancing both training efficiency and representation coherence across modalities.

Works such as Wukong, HiFormer, and DHEN have attempted to increase the complexity of interaction structures in ranking models and validate scaling laws between performance and parameters/FLOPs by stacking multiple layers. However, their experimental scale remains relatively limited. Our previous work introduced the TokenMixer architecture, an efficient variant of the standard Transformer where the self-attention mechanism is replaced by a simple reshape operation, and the feed-forward network is adapted to a pertoken FFN. The effectiveness of this architecture was demonstrated in the ranking stage by the model presented in the RankMixer paper. However, this foundational TokenMixer architecture itself has several design limitations. In this paper, we propose TokenMixer-Large, which systematically addresses these core issues: sub-optimal residual design, insufficient gradient updates in deep models, incomplete MoE sparsification, and limited exploration of scalability. By leveraging a mixing-and-reverting operation, inter-layer residuals, the auxiliary loss and a novel Sparse-Pertoken MoE architecture, TokenMixer-Large successfully scales its parameters to 7-billion and 15-billion on online traffic and offline experiments, respectively.

Existing methods generally adopted a two-stage \"retrieval-refinement\" strategy to balance effectiveness and efficiency. However, they still suffer from (i) noisy retrieval due to skewed data distribution and (ii) lack of semantic understanding in refinement. While semantic enhancement, e.g., LLMs modeling or semantic embeddings, offers potential solutions to these two challenges, these approaches face impractical inference costs or insufficient representation granularity. Obsorbing multi-granularity and lightness merits of semantic identity (SID), we propose a novel paradigm that equips retrieval and refinement in Lifelong User Modeling with SEmantic IDs (R2LED) to address these issues. First, we introduce a Multi-route Mixed Retrieval for the retrieval stage. On the one hand, it captures users' interests from various granularities by several parallel recall routes. On the other hand, a mixed retrieval mechanism is proposed to efficiently retrieve candidates from both collaborative and semantic views, reducing noise. Then, for refinement, we design a Bi-level Fusion Refinement, including a target-aware cross-attention for route-level fusion and a gate mechanism for SID-level fusion. It can bridge the gap between semantic and collaborative spaces, exerting the merits of SID. The comprehensive experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method in both performance and efficiency.

However, advertising fatigue reduces the effectiveness of repeated slogans, creating a growing demand for novel, creative, and insightful slogan generation. While recent work leverages large language models (LLMs) for this task, existing approaches often produce stylistically redundant outputs that lack a clear brand persona and appear overtly machine-generated. We argue that effective slogans should balance novelty with familiarity and propose a new paradigm that recontextualizes persona-related famous quotes for slogan generation. Well-known quotes naturally align with slogan-length text, employ rich rhetorical devices, and offer depth and insight, making them a powerful resource for creative generation. Technically, we introduce a modular framework that decomposes slogan generation into interpretable subtasks, including quote matching, structural decomposition, vocabulary replacement, and remix generation.

Mainstream approaches typically employ a dual-tower architecture between queries and items, and perform joint optimization of intra-tower and inter-tower tasks. However, we observe that joint optimization often leads to certain modalities dominating the training process, while other modalities are neglected. In addition, inconsistent training speeds across modalities can easily result in the one-epoch problem. To address these challenges, we propose a staged pretraining strategy, which guides the model to focus on specialized tasks at each stage, enabling it to effectively attend to and utilize multimodal features, and allowing flexible control over the training process at each stage to avoid the one-epoch problem. Furthermore, to better utilize the semantic IDs that compress high-dimensional multimodal embeddings, we design both generative and discriminative tasks to help the model understand the associations between SIDs, queries, and item features, thereby improving overall performance. Extensive experiments on large-scale real-world Meituan data demonstrate that our method achieves improvements of 3.80%, 2.64%, and 2.17% on R@5, R@10, and R@20, and 5.10%, 4.22%, and 2.09% on N@5, N@10, and N@20 compared to mainstream baselines.

Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) is a widely adopted solution that enhances LVLMs by providing additional contexts from an external Knowledge Base. However, we observe that previous decoding methods for RAG are sub-optimal as they fail to sufficiently leverage multiple relevant contexts and suppress the negative effects of irrelevant contexts. To this end, we propose Relevance-aware Multi-context Contrastive Decoding (RMCD), a novel decoding method for RAG. RMCD outputs a final prediction by combining outputs predicted with each context, where each output is weighted based on its relevance to the question. By doing so, RMCD effectively aggregates useful information from multiple relevant contexts while also counteracting the negative effects of irrelevant ones. Experiments show that RMCD consistently outperforms other decoding methods across multiple LVLMs, achieving the best performance on three knowledge-intensive visual question-answering benchmarks. Also, RMCD can be simply applied by replacing the decoding method of LVLMs without additional training. Analyses also show that RMCD is robust to the retrieval results, consistently performing the best across the weakest to the strongest retrieval results.

Evaluations across three benchmark datasets confirm that Cotten4Rec achieves considerable reductions in memory and runtime with minimal compromise in recommendation accuracy, demonstrating Cotten4Rec's viability as an efficient alternative for practical, large-scale sequential recommendation scenarios where computational resources are critical.", "AI": {"tldr": "Cotten4Rec\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u7684CUDA\u5185\u6838\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017", "motivation": "Transformer-based\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982BERT4Rec\uff09\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u5176\u57fa\u4e8eSoftmax\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u4e2d\u95f4\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u63a8\u8350\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u662f\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCotten4Rec\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e2a\u4f18\u5316\u7684CUDA\u5185\u6838\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4e2d\u95f4\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u5185\u6838\u542f\u52a8\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cCotten4Rec\u76f8\u6bd4BERT4Rec\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u57fa\u51c6LinRec\uff0c\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63a8\u8350\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u635f\u5931\u6700\u5c0f\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u8bcd\u6c47\u91cf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u660e\u663e\u3002", "conclusion": "Cotten4Rec\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u8350\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

However, most agent memory systems only emphasize semantic recall and treat experience as structures such as key-value, vector, or graph, which makes them struggle to represent and retrieve coherent events. To address this challenge, we propose a Character-and-Scene based memory architecture(CAST) inspired by dramatic theory. Specifically, CAST constructs 3D scenes (time/place/topic) and organizes them into character profiles that summarize the events of a character to represent episodic memory. Moreover, CAST complements this episodic memory with a graph-based semantic memory, which yields a robust dual memory design. Experiments demonstrate that CAST has averagely improved 8.11% F1 and 10.21% J(LLM-as-a-Judge) than baselines on various datasets, especially on open and time-sensitive conversational questions.", "AI": {"tldr": "CAST\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u620f\u5267\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa3D\u573a\u666f\uff08\u65f6\u95f4/\u5730\u70b9/\u4e3b\u9898\uff09\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6210\u89d2\u8272\u6863\u6848\u6765\u8868\u793a\u60c5\u666f\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5f62\u6210\u53cc\u91cd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5bf9\u8bdd\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3b\u8981\u5f3a\u8c03\u8bed\u4e49\u56de\u5fc6\uff0c\u5c06\u7ecf\u9a8c\u89c6\u4e3a\u952e\u503c\u3001\u5411\u91cf\u6216\u56fe\u7b49\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8868\u793a\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u60c5\u666f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u591f\u56de\u5fc6\u57fa\u4e8e\u8c01\u3001\u4f55\u65f6\u3001\u4f55\u5730\u7684\u8fde\u8d2f\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8fd9\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u53d7\u5230\u620f\u5267\u7406\u8bba\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u51faCAST\uff08Character-and-Scene based memory architecture\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff1a1\uff09\u6784\u5efa3D\u573a\u666f\uff08\u65f6\u95f4/\u5730\u70b9/\u4e3b\u9898\uff09\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6210\u89d2\u8272\u6863\u6848\uff0c\u603b\u7ed3\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u6240\u6709\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6765\u8868\u793a\u60c5\u666f\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff1b2\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u53cc\u91cd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCAST\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4e868.11%\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u548c10.21%\u7684J(LLM-as-a-Judge)\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "CAST\u901a\u8fc7\u620f\u5267\u7406\u8bba\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u573a\u666f\u67b6\u6784\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u60c5\u666f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8868\u793a\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u53cc\u91cd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u548c\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

As the field enters the \"second half,\" the central challenge becomes real utility in long-horizon, dynamic, and user-dependent environments, where agents face context explosion and must continuously accumulate, manage, and selectively reuse large volumes of information across extended interactions. Memory, with hundreds of papers released this year, therefore emerges as the critical solution to fill the utility gap. In this survey, we provide a unified view of foundation agent memory along three dimensions: memory substrate (internal and external), cognitive mechanism (episodic, semantic, sensory, working, and procedural), and memory subject (agent- and user-centric).

PersonaPlex is trained on a large-scale synthetic dataset of paired prompts and user-agent conversations, generated with open-source large language models (LLM) and text-to-speech (TTS) models. To evaluate role conditioning in real-world settings, we extend the Full-Duplex-Bench benchmark beyond a single assistant role to multi-role customer service scenarios.

These restrictions render them insufficient for many subjective tasks such as toxicity and hate-speech detection. For this reason, we introduce a quantifiable metric, paired with a statistical significance test, that attributes polarization to various annotator groups. Our metric enables direct comparisons between heavily imbalanced sociodemographic and ideological subgroups across different datasets and tasks, while also enabling analysis on multi-label settings. We apply this metric to three datasets on hate speech, and one on toxicity detection, discovering that: (1) Polarization is strongly and persistently attributed to annotator race, especially on the hate speech task. (2) Religious annotators do not fundamentally disagree with each other, but do with other annotators, a trend that is gradually diminished and then reversed with irreligious annotators.

Revocable decoding mitigates this by rechecking earlier tokens, yet we observe that existing verification schemes frequently trigger flip-flop oscillations, where tokens are remasked and later restored unchanged. This behaviour slows inference in two ways: remasking verified positions weakens the conditioning context for parallel drafting, and repeated remask cycles consume the revision budget with little net progress. We propose COVER (Cache Override Verification for Efficient Revision), which performs leave-one-out verification and stable drafting within a single forward pass. COVER constructs two attention views via KV cache override: selected seeds are masked for verification, while their cached key value states are injected for all other queries to preserve contextual information, with a closed form diagonal correction preventing self leakage at the seed positions. COVER further prioritises seeds using a stability aware score that balances uncertainty, downstream influence, and cache drift, and it adapts the number of verified seeds per step. Across benchmarks, COVER markedly reduces unnecessary revisions and yields faster decoding while preserving output quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "COVER\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7KV\u7f13\u5b58\u8986\u76d6\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u4fee\u8ba2\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u89e3\u7801\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u53ef\u64a4\u9500\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\"\u7ffb\u8f6c\u632f\u8361\"\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u4ee4\u724c\u88ab\u91cd\u65b0\u63a9\u7801\u540e\u53c8\u6062\u590d\u539f\u72b6\uff0c\u8fd9\u524a\u5f31\u4e86\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5e76\u6d88\u8017\u4e86\u4fee\u8ba2\u9884\u7b97\u5374\u51e0\u4e4e\u6ca1\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "method": "COVER\u91c7\u7528KV\u7f13\u5b58\u8986\u76d6\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u4e24\u4e2a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u89c6\u56fe\uff1a\u5bf9\u9009\u5b9a\u7684\u79cd\u5b50\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8fdb\u884c\u63a9\u7801\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u5b83\u4eec\u7684KV\u72b6\u6001\u6ce8\u5165\u5176\u4ed6\u67e5\u8be2\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u95ed\u5f0f\u5bf9\u89d2\u7ebf\u6821\u6b63\u9632\u6b62\u81ea\u6cc4\u6f0f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cCOVER\u4f7f\u7528\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u6570\u6765\u4f18\u5148\u9009\u62e9\u79cd\u5b50\uff0c\u5e76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u6bcf\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u79cd\u5b50\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCOVER\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u4fee\u8ba2\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "COVER\u901a\u8fc7KV\u7f13\u5b58\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u79cd\u5b50\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5e76\u884c\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u7ffb\u8f6c\u632f\u8361\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

Chen"], "title": "Uncertainty Drives Social Bias Changes in Quantized Large Language Models", "comment": "12 pages, 6 figures", "summary": "Post-training quantization reduces the computational cost of large language models but fundamentally alters their social biases in ways that aggregate metrics fail to capture. We present the first large-scale study of 50 quantized models evaluated on PostTrainingBiasBench, a unified benchmark of 13 closed- and open-ended bias datasets. We identify a phenomenon we term quantization-induced masked bias flipping, in which up to 21% of responses flip between biased and unbiased states after quantization, despite showing no change in aggregate bias scores. These flips are strongly driven by model uncertainty, where the responses with high uncertainty are 3-11x more likely to change than the confident ones. Quantization strength amplifies this effect, with 4-bit quantized models exhibiting 4-6x more behavioral changes than 8-bit quantized models. Critically, these changes create asymmetric impacts across demographic groups, where bias can worsen by up to 18.6% for some groups while improving by 14.1% for others, yielding misleadingly neutral aggregate outcomes. Larger models show no consistent robustness advantage, and group-specific shifts vary unpredictably across model families. Our findings demonstrate that compression fundamentally alters bias patterns, requiring crucial post-quantization evaluation and interventions to ensure reliability in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91cf\u5316\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f1a\u6539\u53d8\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u603b\u4f53\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0c\u4e5f\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u91cf\u5316\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u7ffb\u8f6c\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u7fa4\u4f53\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u53ef\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9\u5176\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u4e86\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u805a\u5408\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u63a9\u76d6\u91cf\u5316\u5bf9\u504f\u89c1\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5bf950\u4e2a\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528PostTrainingBiasBench\u7edf\u4e00\u57fa\u51c6\uff08\u5305\u542b13\u4e2a\u5c01\u95ed\u5f0f\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u504f\u89c1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff084\u4f4d\u548c8\u4f4d\uff09\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u5217\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u7ffb\u8f6c\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09\u91cf\u5316\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u8fbe21%\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u5728\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u65e0\u504f\u89c1\u72b6\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u7ffb\u8f6c\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u603b\u4f53\u504f\u89c1\u5206\u6570\u4e0d\u53d8\uff1b2\uff09\u8fd9\u79cd\u7ffb\u8f6c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u9ad8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u54cd\u5e94\u7ffb\u8f6c\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u662f\u4f4e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u76843-11\u500d\uff1b3\uff094\u4f4d\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5316\u662f8\u4f4d\u6a21\u578b\u76844-6\u500d\uff1b4\uff09\u504f\u89c1\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u4eba\u53e3\u7fa4\u4f53\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9b\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u6076\u5316\u9ad8\u8fbe18.6%\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4ed6\u7fa4\u4f53\u6539\u5584\u8fbe14.1%\uff1b5\uff09\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u6ca1\u6709\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u7fa4\u4f53\u7279\u5b9a\u53d8\u5316\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u5217\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u538b\u7f29\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u504f\u89c1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u805a\u5408\u6307\u6807\u5177\u6709\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u3002\u4e3a\u786e\u4fdd\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u5173\u952e\u7684\u540e\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u3002"}}

Interpreting the dynamics of reasoning tokens with Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA)", "comment": null, "summary": "Test-time compute is central to large reasoning models, yet analysing their reasoning behaviour through generated text is increasingly impractical and unreliable. Response length is often used as a brute proxy for reasoning effort, but this metric fails to capture the dynamics and effectiveness of the Chain of Thoughts (CoT) or the generated tokens. We propose Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) as a non-textual alternative for analysing model's reasoning chains at test time. By treating token generation as a dynamical system, we extract hidden embeddings at each generation step and apply RQA to the resulting trajectories. RQA metrics, including Determinism and Laminarity, quantify patterns of repetition and stalling in the model's latent representations. Analysing 3,600 generation traces from DeepSeek-R1-Distill, we show that RQA captures signals not reflected by response length, but also substantially improves prediction of task complexity by 8\\%.

We introduce the Medical Prompt Injection Benchmark (MPIB), a dataset-and-benchmark suite for evaluating clinical safety under both direct prompt injection and indirect, RAG-mediated injection across clinically grounded tasks. MPIB emphasizes outcome-level risk via the Clinical Harm Event Rate (CHER), which measures high-severity clinical harm events under a clinically grounded taxonomy, and reports CHER alongside Attack Success Rate (ASR) to disentangle instruction compliance from downstream patient risk. The benchmark comprises 9,697 curated instances constructed through multi-stage quality gates and clinical safety linting. Evaluating MPIB across a diverse set of baseline LLMs and defense configurations, we find that ASR and CHER can diverge substantially, and that robustness depends critically on whether adversarial instructions appear in the user query or in retrieved context. We release MPIB with evaluation code, adversarial baselines, and comprehensive documentation to support reproducible and systematic research on clinical prompt injection. Code and data are available at GitHub (code) and Hugging Face (data).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u533b\u7597\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u57fa\u51c6\uff08MPIB\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u76f4\u63a5\u548c\u95f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u6216\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5305\u542b9,697\u4e2a\u7cbe\u5fc3\u6784\u5efa\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684MPIB\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b89\u5168\u68c0\u67e5\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4e34\u5e8a\u4f24\u5bb3\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7387\uff08CHER\uff09\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u9ad8\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u4e34\u5e8a\u4f24\u5bb3\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff08ASR\uff09\u4e00\u8d77\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u4ece\u6027\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u60a3\u8005\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d1\u73b0ASR\u548cCHER\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5173\u952e\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6307\u4ee4\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u8fd8\u662f\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u3002\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee3\u7801\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u6587\u6863\u3002", "conclusion": "MPIB\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u533a\u5206\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u4e34\u5e8a\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e34\u5e8aAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in reasoning over textual transcriptions for emotion recognition, they typically neglect fine-grained prosodic information, limiting their effectiveness and interpretability. In this work, we propose VowelPrompt, a linguistically grounded framework that augments LLM-based emotion recognition with interpretable, fine-grained vowel-level prosodic cues. Drawing on phonetic evidence that vowels serve as primary carriers of affective prosody, VowelPrompt extracts pitch-, energy-, and duration-based descriptors from time-aligned vowel segments, and converts these features into natural language descriptions for better interpretability. Such a design enables LLMs to jointly reason over lexical semantics and fine-grained prosodic variation. Moreover, we adopt a two-stage adaptation procedure comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR), implemented via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to enhance reasoning capability, enforce structured output adherence, and improve generalization across domains and speaker variations. Extensive evaluations across diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that VowelPrompt consistently outperforms state-of-the-art emotion recognition methods under zero-shot, fine-tuned, cross-domain, and cross-linguistic conditions, while enabling the generation of interpretable explanations that are jointly grounded in contextual semantics and fine-grained prosodic structure.", "AI": {"tldr": "VowelPrompt\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5143\u97f3\u7ea7\u97f5\u5f8b\u7ebf\u7d22\u6765\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u9886\u57df\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bed\u97f3\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u7406\u89e3\u8bed\u8a00\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u58f0\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709LLM\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6587\u672c\u8f6c\u5f55\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u97f5\u5f8b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u6548\u679c\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "1. \u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u97f3\u5b66\u8bc1\u636e\u63d0\u53d6\u5143\u97f3\u6bb5\u7684\u97f3\u9ad8\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u65f6\u957f\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff1b2. \u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\uff1b3. \u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u63a5\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RLVR\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528GRPO\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cVowelPrompt\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u548c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u97f5\u5f8b\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "VowelPrompt\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u5143\u97f3\u7ea7\u97f5\u5f8b\u4fe1\u606f\u6574\u5408\u5230LLM\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

We hypothesize that a meaningful solution should contain enough method-level information that, when applied to a neighborhood of related questions, it should yield better downstream performance than incorrect solutions. Building on this idea, we propose \\textbf{Consequence-Based Utility}, an oracle-free evaluator that scores each candidate by testing its value as an in-context exemplar in solving related yet verifiable questions. Our approach is evaluated on an original set of research-level math problems, each paired with one expert-written solution and nine LLM-generated solutions.

Disfluencies, repetition, ellipsis, and discourse-driven structure routinely violate standard Universal Dependencies (UD) assumptions, causing parsers and large language models (LLMs) to fail despite strong performance on written data. These failures are compounded by rigid evaluation metrics that conflate genuine structural errors with acceptable variation. In this work, we present a systems-oriented approach to spoken CSW parsing. We introduce a linguistically grounded taxonomy of spoken CSW phenomena and SpokeBench, an expert-annotated gold benchmark designed to test spoken-language structure beyond standard UD assumptions. We further propose FLEX-UD, an ambiguity-aware evaluation metric, which reveals that existing parsing techniques perform poorly on spoken CSW by penalizing linguistically plausible analyses as errors. We then propose DECAP, a decoupled agentic parsing framework that isolates spoken-phenomena handling from core syntactic analysis. Experiments show that DECAP produces more robust and interpretable parses without retraining and achieves up to 52.6% improvements over existing parsing techniques. FLEX-UD evaluations further reveal qualitative improvements that are masked by standard metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u53e3\u8bed\u8bed\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u53e5\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u89e3\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u53e3\u8bed\u8bed\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\u5728\u53e5\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u4e0a\u9762\u4e34\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e0d\u6d41\u7545\u3001\u91cd\u590d\u3001\u7701\u7565\u548c\u8bdd\u8bed\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8fdd\u53cd\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u4f9d\u5b58\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u6790\u5668\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53e3\u8bed\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u7684\u53e3\u8bed\u8bed\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\u73b0\u8c61\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff1b2\uff09\u521b\u5efa\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u9ec4\u91d1\u57fa\u51c6SpokeBench\uff1b3\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u7cca\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807FLEX-UD\uff1b4\uff09\u5f00\u53d1\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u89e3\u6790\u6846\u67b6DECAP\u3002", "result": "DECAP\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4e0d\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u6790\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8652.6%\u3002FLEX-UD\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u6307\u6807\u63a9\u76d6\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53e3\u8bed\u8bed\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\u89e3\u6790\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u8d8a\u6807\u51c6UD\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bfc\u5411\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u548c\u89e3\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u53e3\u8bed\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u53e3\u8bed\u73b0\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While large language models (LLMs) show promise in this domain, their precise causal estimation capabilities are still limited, and the impact of post-training on these abilities is insufficiently explored. This paper examines the extent to which post-training can enhance LLMs' capacity for causal inference. We introduce CauGym, a comprehensive dataset comprising seven core causal tasks for training and five diverse test sets. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluate five post-training approaches: SFT, DPO, KTO, PPO, and GRPO. Across five in-domain and four existing benchmarks, our experiments demonstrate that appropriate post-training enables smaller LLMs to perform causal inference competitively, often surpassing much larger models. Our 14B parameter model achieves 93.5% accuracy on the CaLM benchmark, compared to 55.4% by OpenAI o3. Furthermore, the post-trained LLMs exhibit strong generalization and robustness under real-world conditions such as distribution shifts and noisy data.

By reusing the frozen LLM's own parameters in an in-context hypernetwork design and introducing architectural innovations, SHINE overcomes key limitations of prior hypernetworks and achieves strong expressive power with a relatively small number of parameters. We introduce a pretraining and instruction fine-tuning pipeline, and train our hypernetwork to generate high quality LoRA adapters from diverse meaningful contexts in a single forward pass. It updates LLM parameters without any fine-tuning, and immediately enables complex question answering tasks related to the context without directly accessing the context, effectively transforming in-context knowledge to in-parameter knowledge in one pass. Our work achieves outstanding results on various tasks, greatly saves time, computation and memory costs compared to SFT-based LLM adaptation, and shows great potential for scaling.

However, for structured text classification problems with fixed label spaces, model selection is often driven by predictive performance alone, overlooking operational constraints encountered in production systems.\n  In this work, we present a systematic comparison of two contrasting paradigms for text classification: zero- and few-shot prompt-based large language models, and fully fine-tuned encoder-only architectures. We evaluate these approaches across four canonical benchmarks (IMDB, SST-2, AG News, and DBPedia), measuring predictive quality (macro F1), inference latency, and monetary cost.\n  We frame model evaluation as a multi-objective decision problem and analyze trade-offs using Pareto frontier projections and a parameterized utility function reflecting different deployment regimes. Our results show that fine-tuned encoder-based models from the BERT family achieve competitive, and often superior, classification performance while operating at one to two orders of magnitude lower cost and latency compared to zero- and few-shot LLM prompting.\n  Overall, our findings suggest that indiscriminate use of large language models for standard text classification workloads can lead to suboptimal system-level outcomes. Instead, fine-tuned encoders emerge as robust and efficient components for structured NLP pipelines, while LLMs are better positioned as complementary elements within hybrid architectures.

In this work, we focus on Markdown formatting, which is ubiquitous in assistants, documentation, and tool-augmented pipelines but still prone to subtle, hard-to-detect errors (e.g., broken lists, malformed tables, inconsistent headings, and invalid code blocks) that can significantly degrade downstream usability. We present FMBench, a benchmark for adaptive Markdown output formatting that evaluates models under a wide range of instruction-following scenarios with diverse structural requirements. FMBench emphasizes real-world formatting behaviors such as multi-level organization, mixed content (natural language interleaved with lists/tables/code), and strict adherence to user-specified layout constraints. To improve Markdown compliance without relying on hard decoding constraints, we propose a lightweight alignment pipeline that combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning fine-tuning. Starting from a base model, we first perform SFT on instruction-response pairs, and then optimize a composite objective that balances semantic fidelity with structural correctness. Experiments on two model families (OpenPangu and Qwen) show that SFT consistently improves semantic alignment, while reinforcement learning provides additional gains in robustness to challenging Markdown instructions when initialized from a strong SFT policy. Our results also reveal an inherent trade-off between semantic and structural objectives, highlighting the importance of carefully designed rewards for reliable formatted generation.

However, they still recompute the attention and feed-forward blocks for every token position at every step -- even when many unmasked tokens are essentially fixed, resulting in substantial waste in compute. We propose SureLock: when the posterior at an unmasked position has stabilized across steps (our sure condition), we lock that position -- thereafter skipping its query projection and feed-forward sublayers -- while caching its attention keys and values so other positions can continue to attend to it. This reduces the dominant per-iteration computational cost from $O(N^2d)$ to $O(MNd)$ where $N$ is the sequence length, $M$ is the number of unlocked token positions, and $d$ is the model dimension. In practice, $M$ decreases as the iteration progresses, yielding substantial savings. On LLaDA-8B, SureLock reduces algorithmic FLOPs by 30--50% relative to the same sampler without locking, while maintaining comparable generation quality. We also provide a theoretical analysis to justify the design rationale of SureLock: monitoring only the local KL at the lock step suffices to bound the deviation in final token probabilities.

Humor generation, especially in multi-modal scenarios, is a challenging task for large language models (LLMs), which is typically as funny caption generation for images, requiring visual understanding, humor reasoning, creative imagination, and so on. Existing LLM-based approaches rely on reasoning chains or self-improvement, which suffer from limited creativity and interpretability. To address these bottlenecks, we develop a novel LLM-based humor generation mechanism based on a fundamental humor theory, GTVH. To produce funny and script-opposite captions, we introduce a humor-theory-driven multi-role LLM collaboration framework augmented with humor retrieval (HOMER). The framework consists of three LLM-based roles: (1) conflicting-script extractor that grounds humor in key script oppositions, forming the basis of caption generation; (2) retrieval-augmented hierarchical imaginator that identifies key humor targets and expands the creative space of them through diverse associations structured as imagination trees; and (3) caption generator that produces funny and diverse captions conditioned on the obtained knowledge.

One of the most popular emotion models used in this context is the wheel of emotion proposed by Plutchik. This model schematizes human emotions in a circular structure, and represents them in two or three dimensions. However, the validity of Plutchik's wheel of emotion has not been sufficiently examined. This study investigated the validity of the wheel by creating and analyzing a semantic networks of emotion words.

Prior jailbreaking research has explored diverse approaches, including prompt optimization, automated red teaming, obfuscation, and reinforcement learning (RL) based methods. However, most existing techniques fail to effectively leverage vulnerabilities revealed in earlier interaction turns, resulting in inefficient and unstable attacks. Since jailbreaking involves sequential interactions in which each response influences future actions, reinforcement learning provides a natural framework for this problem. Motivated by this, we propose a history-aware RL-based jailbreak framework that analyzes and reweights vulnerability signals from prior steps to guide future decisions. We show that incorporating historical information alone improves jailbreak success rates. Building on this insight, we introduce an attention-based reweighting mechanism that highlights critical vulnerabilities within the interaction history, enabling more efficient exploration with fewer queries. Extensive experiments on AdvBench and HarmBench demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art jailbreak performance while significantly improving query efficiency. These results underscore the importance of historical vulnerability signals in reinforcement learning-driven jailbreak strategies and offer a principled pathway for advancing adversarial research on LLM safeguards.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8d8a\u72f1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5e76\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u5148\u524d\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u8d8a\u72f1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8d8a\u72f1\u6280\u672f\u5927\u591a\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u5148\u524d\u4ea4\u4e92\u8f6e\u6b21\u4e2d\u66b4\u9732\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u4e14\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u8d8a\u72f1\u6d89\u53ca\u5e8f\u5217\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u6b64\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5386\u53f2\u611f\u77e5\u7684RL\u8d8a\u72f1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5e76\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u5148\u524d\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u672a\u6765\u51b3\u7b56\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7a81\u51fa\u4ea4\u4e92\u5386\u53f2\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728AdvBench\u548cHarmBench\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u67e5\u8be2\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5386\u53f2\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a8\u8fdb\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

This limitation is particularly acute in light-parameter LLMs which are essential for privacy-preserving and efficient clinical deployment. Existing training paradigms prioritize linguistic fluency over structured clinical logic and result in a fundamental misalignment with professional diagnostic cognition. Here we introduce ClinMPO, a reinforcement learning framework designed to align the internal reasoning of LLMs with professional psychiatric practice. The framework employs a specialized reward model trained independently on a dataset derived from 4,474 psychiatry journal articles and structured according to evidence-based medicine principles. We evaluated ClinMPO on a unseen subset of the benchmark designed to isolate reasoning capabilities from rote memorization. This test set comprises items where leading large-parameter LLMs consistently fail. We compared the ClinMPO-aligned light LLM performance against a cohort of 300 medical students.

A key challenge is that generation difficulty varies within a single output, whereas existing efficiency-oriented approaches either ignore this intra-generation variation or rely on supervised token-level routing with high system complexity. We present \\textbf{RelayGen}, a training-free, segment-level runtime model switching framework that exploits difficulty variation in long-form reasoning. Through offline analysis of generation uncertainty using token probability margins, we show that coarse-grained segment-level control is sufficient to capture difficulty transitions within a reasoning trajectory. RelayGen identifies model-specific switch cues that signal transitions to lower-difficulty segments and dynamically delegates their continuation to a smaller model, while preserving high-difficulty reasoning on the large model. Across multiple reasoning benchmarks, RelayGen substantially reduces inference latency while preserving most of the accuracy of large models.

As a result, recent work is increasing the focus on continual learning from real-world deployment, where user interaction logs provide a rich source of authentic human feedback and procedural knowledge. However, learning from user logs is challenging due to their unstructured and noisy nature. Vanilla LLM systems often struggle to distinguish useful feedback signals from noisy user behavior, and the disparity between user log collection and model optimization (e.g., the off-policy optimization problem) further strengthens the problem. To this end, we propose UNO (User log-driveN Optimization), a unified framework for improving LLM systems (LLMsys) with user logs. UNO first distills logs into semi-structured rules and preference pairs, then employs query-and-feedback-driven clustering to manage data heterogeneity, and finally quantifies the cognitive gap between the model's prior knowledge and the log data. This assessment guides the LLMsys to adaptively filter out noisy feedback and construct different modules for primary and reflective experiences extracted from user logs, thereby improving future responses. Extensive experiments show that UNO achieves state-of-the-art effectiveness and efficiency, significantly outperforming Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and memory-based baselines.

Motivated by recent results that residual wide-narrow-wide (hourglass) MLPs offer superior function approximation capabilities, we revisit the long-standing MLP shape convention in Transformer, challenging the necessity of the narrow-wide-narrow design. To study this, we develop a Transformer variant that replaces the conventional FFN with a deeper hourglass-shaped FFN, comprising a stack of hourglass sub-MLPs connected by residual pathways. We posit that a deeper but lighter hourglass FFN can serve as a competitive alternative to the conventional FFN, and that parameters saved by using a lighter hourglass FFN can be more effectively utilized, such as by enlarging model hidden dimensions under fixed budgets. We confirm these through empirical validations across model scales: hourglass FFNs outperform conventional FFNs up to 400M and achieve comparable performance at larger scales to 1B parameters; hourglass FFN variants with reduced FFN and increased attention parameters show consistent improvements over conventional configurations at matched budgets. Together, these findings shed new light on recent work and prompt a rethinking of the narrow-wide-narrow MLP convention and the balance between attention and FFN towards efficient and expressive modern language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u6311\u6218\u4e86Transformer\u4e2d\u7a84-\u5bbd-\u7a84MLP\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u66f4\u6df1\u4f46\u66f4\u8f7b\u7684hourglass\u5f62\u72b6MLP\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edfFFN\uff0c\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Transformer\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u666e\u904d\u91c7\u7528\u7a84-\u5bbd-\u7a84MLP\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f46\u6700\u8fd1\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5bbd-\u7a84-\u5bbd\uff08hourglass\uff09\u5f62\u72b6\u7684MLP\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6Transformer\u4e2dMLP\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u957f\u671f\u60ef\u4f8b\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u7a84-\u5bbd-\u7a84\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2aTransformer\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u7528\u66f4\u6df1\u5c42\u7684hourglass\u5f62\u72b6FFN\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edfFFN\u3002\u8be5hourglass FFN\u7531\u591a\u4e2ahourglass\u5b50MLP\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u5806\u53e0\u800c\u6210\u3002\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11FFN\u53c2\u6570\u6765\u589e\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u9690\u85cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6216\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728400M\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\uff0chourglass FFN\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfFFN\uff1b\u57281B\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\u3002\u5728\u5339\u914d\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11FFN\u53c2\u6570\u5e76\u589e\u52a0\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53c2\u6570\u7684hourglass\u53d8\u4f53\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u914d\u7f6e\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "hourglass FFN\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f20\u7edfFFN\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u8282\u7701\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4fc3\u4f7f\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u7a84-\u5bbd-\u7a84MLP\u60ef\u4f8b\u4ee5\u53ca\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0eFFN\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

While LLMs and LLM-human hybrid strategies reduce costly human effort, they remain prone to LLM overconfidence and ineffective AI-to-human escalation. To address this, we propose DREAM, a multi-round debate-based relevance assessment framework with LLM agents, built on opposing initial stances and iterative reciprocal critique. Through our agreement-based debate, it yields more accurate labeling for certain cases and more reliable AI-to-human escalation for uncertain ones, achieving 95.2% labeling accuracy with only 3.5% human involvement. Using DREAM, we build BRIDGE, a refined benchmark that mitigates evaluation bias and enables fairer retriever comparison by uncovering 29,824 missing relevant chunks. We then re-benchmark IR systems and extend evaluation to RAG, showing that unaddressed holes not only distort retriever rankings but also drive retrieval-generation misalignment.

We factorize reasoning into a continuous latent thought vector (what to reason about) and a decoder that verbalizes the trace conditioned on this vector (how to reason). Beyond serving as a declarative buffer, latent thought vectors compress the reasoning structure into a continuous representation that abstracts away surface-level token variability, making gradient-based optimization over reasoning strategies well-posed. Our prior model maps unstructured noise to a learned manifold of valid reasoning patterns, and at test time we employ a Gibbs-style procedure that alternates between generating a candidate trace and optimizing the latent vector to better explain that trace, effectively navigating the latent manifold to refine the reasoning strategy. Training a 0.2B-parameter model from scratch on GSM8K, our method with 30 rethinking iterations surpasses baselines with 10 to 15 times more parameters, including a 3B counterpart.

Recent work has addressed this problem by scaling self-consistency and parallel thinking, adding generic ``thinking tokens'' and prompting models to re-read the question before answering. Unfortunately, these approaches either inject task-agnostic tokens or mandate heuristics that do not explain -- and often ignore -- the \\emph{spontaneous} repetition that many LRMs exhibit at the head of their internal chains. In contrast, we analyze and harness the model's tendency to restate the question, which we term the \\emph{Echo of Prompt (EOP)}, as a front-loaded, compute-shaping mechanism. We formalize its probabilistic cost by casting echo removal as rejection-based conditioning and defining the \\emph{Echo Likelihood Gap} $\u0394\\mathcal{L}$ as a computable proxy. This provides the missing theoretical link that links early repetition to likelihood gains and downstream accuracy. However, it does not by itself specify how to exploit EOP. Consequently, we develop \\emph{Echo-Distilled SFT (ED-SFT)} to instill an ``echo-then-reason'' pattern through supervised finetuning, and \\emph{Echoic Prompting (EP)} to re-ground the model mid-trace without training. While promising, quantifying benefits beyond verbosity is non-trivial. Therefore, we conduct length and suffix-controlled likelihood analyses together with layer-wise attention studies, showing that EOP increases answer to answer-prefix attention in middle layers, consistent with an \\emph{attention refocusing} mechanism. We evaluate on GSM8K, MathQA, Hendrycks-MATH, AIME24, and MATH-500 under identical decoding settings and budgets, and find consistent gains over baselines.

Mitigating Toxicity from LLM Generations through Subspace Intervention", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful text generators, yet they can produce toxic or harmful content even when given seemingly harmless prompts. This presents a serious safety challenge and can cause real-world harm. Toxicity is often subtle and context-dependent, making it difficult to detect at the token level or through coarse sentence-level signals. Moreover, efforts to mitigate toxicity often face a trade-off between safety and the coherence, or fluency of the generated text. In this work, we present a targeted subspace intervention strategy for identifying and suppressing hidden toxic patterns from underlying model representations, while preserving overall ability to generate safe fluent content. On the RealToxicityPrompts, our method achieves strong mitigation performance compared to existing baselines, with minimal impact on inference complexity. Across multiple LLMs, our approach reduces toxicity of state-of-the-art detoxification systems by 8-20%, while maintaining comparable fluency. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses, we show that our approach achieves effective toxicity reduction without impairing generative performance, consistently outperforming existing baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9LLM\u9690\u85cf\u6bd2\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e72\u9884\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u6bd2\u6027", "motivation": "LLM\u5373\u4f7f\u63a5\u6536\u65e0\u5bb3\u63d0\u793a\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6bd2\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u6bd2\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u56f0\u96be", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e72\u9884\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ece\u5e95\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u6bd2\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f", "result": "\u5728RealToxicityPrompts\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6bd2\u6027\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u6bd2\u6027\u51cf\u5c118-20%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4eLLM\u6bd2\u6027\u800c\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861"}}

To address these issues, we propose FairJudge, an adaptive, debiased, and consistent LLM-as-a-Judge. Unlike prior approaches that treat the judge as a static evaluator, FairJudge models judging behavior itself as a learnable and regularized policy. From a data-centric perspective, we construct a high-information-density judging dataset that explicitly injects supervision signals aligned with evaluation behavior. Building on this dataset, we adopt a curriculum-style SFT-DPO-GRPO training paradigm that progressively aligns rubric adherence, bias mitigation, and cross-mode consistency, while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results on multiple internal and public benchmarks show that FairJudge consistently improves agreement and F1, reduces non-semantic biases, and outperforms substantially larger instruction-tuned LLMs. All resources will be publicly released after acceptance to facilitate future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "FairJudge\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u53bb\u504f\u4e14\u4e00\u81f4\u7684LLM-as-a-Judge\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8bc4\u5224\u884c\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bc4\u5224\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM-as-a-Judge\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6839\u672c\u6027\u5c40\u9650\uff1a1) \u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff1b2) \u7531\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u957f\u5ea6\u3001\u683c\u5f0f\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u6e90\u7b49\u975e\u8bed\u4e49\u7ebf\u7d22\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u89c1\uff1b3) \u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u540c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u70b9\u5f0f\u4e0e\u6210\u5bf9\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u77db\u76fe\u5224\u65ad\u3002", "method": "1) \u5c06\u8bc4\u5224\u884c\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff1b2) \u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u8bc4\u5224\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6ce8\u5165\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b3) \u91c7\u7528\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5f0fSFT-DPO-GRPO\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u9075\u5b88\u5ea6\u3001\u504f\u89c1\u7f13\u89e3\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5185\u90e8\u548c\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cFairJudge\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u975e\u8bed\u4e49\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18LLMs\u3002", "conclusion": "FairJudge\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8bc4\u5224\u884c\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709LLM\u8bc4\u5224\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e09\u5927\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bc4\u5224\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd8\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u6240\u6709\u8d44\u6e90\u5c06\u5728\u63a5\u53d7\u540e\u516c\u5f00\u53d1\u5e03\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Motivated by evidence that LLM layers play distinct functional roles, we hypothesize that mode collapse can be localized to specific layers and that restoring a carefully chosen range of layers to their pre-trained weights can recover diversity while maintaining high output quality. To validate this hypothesis and decide which layers to restore, we design a proxy task -- Constrained Random Character(CRC) -- with an explicit validity set and a natural diversity objective. Results on CRC reveal a clear diversity-validity trade-off across restoration ranges and identify configurations that increase diversity with minimal quality loss. Based on these findings, we propose Selective Layer Restoration (SLR), a training-free method that restores selected layers in a post-trained model to their pre-trained weights, yielding a hybrid model with the same architecture and parameter count, incurring no additional inference cost.

To address this gap, we introduce compar:IA, an open-source digital public service developed inside the French government and designed to collect large-scale human preference data from a predominantly French-speaking general audience. The platform uses a blind pairwise comparison interface to capture unconstrained, real-world prompts and user judgments across a diverse set of language models, while maintaining low participation friction and privacy-preserving automated filtering. As of 2026-02-07, compar:IA has collected over 600,000 free-form prompts and 250,000 preference votes, with approximately 89% of the data in French. We release three complementary datasets -- conversations, votes, and reactions -- under open licenses, and present initial analyses, including a French-language model leaderboard and user interaction patterns.

The present study investigates the potential of prompt engineering for controlling sentiment in LLM-generated text, providing a resource-sensitive and accessible alternative to existing methods. Using Ekman's six basic emotions (e.g., joy, disgust), we examine various prompting techniques, including Zero-Shot and Chain-of-Thought prompting using gpt-3.5-turbo, and compare it to fine-tuning. Our results indicate that prompt engineering effectively steers emotions in AI-generated texts, offering a practical and cost-effective alternative to fine-tuning, especially in data-constrained settings. In this regard, Few-Shot prompting with human-written examples was the most effective among other techniques, likely due to the additional task-specific guidance.

To address this, we introduce \\textbf{Table-as-Search (TaS)}, a structured planning framework that reformulates the InfoSeeking task as a Table Completion task. TaS maps each query into a structured table schema maintained in an external database, where rows represent search candidates and columns denote constraints or required information. This table precisely manages the search states: filled cells strictly record the history and search results, while empty cells serve as an explicit search plan. Crucially, TaS unifies three distinct InfoSeeking tasks: Deep Search, Wide Search, and the challenging DeepWide Search. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TaS significantly outperforms numerous state-of-the-art baselines across three kinds of benchmarks, including multi-agent framework and commercial systems. Furthermore, our analysis validates the TaS's superior robustness in long-horizon InfoSeeking, alongside its efficiency, scalability and flexibility.

To enhance robustness, recent work shifts toward Generative Reward Models (GenRMs) that generate rationales before predicting preferences. Yet in GenRM training and evaluation, practice remains outcome-label-only, leaving reasoning quality unchecked. We show that reasoning fidelity-the consistency between a GenRM's preference decision and reference decision rationales-is highly predictive of downstream RLHF outcomes, beyond standard label accuracy. Specifically, we repurpose existing reward-model benchmarks to compute Spurious Correctness (S-Corr)-the fraction of label-correct decisions with rationales misaligned with golden judgments.

Our findings indicate that classification approaches that leverage these error taxonomies, or \"rubrics\", demonstrate strong error identification compared to baseline methods in technical domains like coding, math, and chemical engineering. These rubrics can be used to build stronger LLM-as-judge reward functions for reasoning model training via reinforcement learning. Experimental results show that these rewards have the potential to improve models' task accuracy on difficult domains over models trained by general LLMs-as-judges by +45%, and approach performance of models trained by verifiable rewards while using as little as 20% as many gold labels. Through our approach, we extend the usage of reward rubrics from assessing qualitative model behavior to assessing quantitative model correctness on tasks typically learned via RLVR rewards.

To better understand how lexical ambiguity can be resolved through the visual domain, we develop an interpretable Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (VWSD) framework. The model leverages CLIP to project ambiguous language and candidate images into a shared multimodal space. We enrich textual embeddings using a dual-channel ensemble of semantic and photo-based prompts with WordNet synonyms, while image embeddings are refined through robust test-time augmentations. We then use cosine similarity to determine the image that best aligns with the ambiguous text. When evaluated on the SemEval-2023 VWSD dataset, enriching the embeddings raises the MRR from 0.7227 to 0.7590 and the Hit Rate from 0.5810 to 0.6220. Ablation studies reveal that dual-channel prompting provides strong, low-latency performance, whereas aggressive image augmentation yields only marginal gains.

While prior work has discovered evidence for both, a mechanistic account of how these properties coexist and transform across tasks remains elusive. We propose that representational sharing lies not in the concepts themselves, but in the geometric relations between them. Using number concepts as a testbed and language models as high-dimensional computational substrates, we show that number representations preserve a stable relational structure across tasks. Task-specific representations are embedded in distinct subspaces, with low-level features like magnitude and parity encoded along separable linear directions. Crucially, we find that these subspaces are largely transformable into one another via linear mappings, indicating that representations share relational structure despite being located in distinct subspaces. Together, these results provide a mechanistic lens of how language models balance the shared structure of number representation with functional flexibility. It suggests that understanding arises when task-specific transformations are applied to a shared underlying relational structure of conceptual representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6570\u5b57\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5171\u4eab\u51e0\u4f55\u5173\u7cfb\u7ed3\u6784\u800c\u975e\u5177\u4f53\u8868\u5f81\u672c\u8eab\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u8868\u5f81\u4f4d\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f46\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u6620\u5c04\u76f8\u4e92\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "motivation": "\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u6982\u5ff5\u8868\u793a\u662f\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5171\u4eab\u6d41\u5f62\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u53d1\u6563\u5230\u6b63\u4ea4\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u5e72\u6270\u3002\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u5171\u5b58\u5e76\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u91ca\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u5b57\u6982\u5ff5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8ba1\u7b97\u57fa\u8d28\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6570\u5b57\u8868\u793a\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u4ee3\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u8868\u793a\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u5b57\u8868\u793a\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u8868\u793a\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u622a\u7136\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f4e\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u5982\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u5947\u5076\u6027\u6cbf\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u5411\u7f16\u7801\uff1b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u6620\u5c04\u76f8\u4e92\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8868\u793a\u5171\u4eab\u5173\u7cfb\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u53d8\u6362\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6982\u5ff5\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u5e95\u5c42\u5173\u7cfb\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u5b57\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u529f\u80fd\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6982\u5ff5\u8868\u793a\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5171\u4eab\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u529f\u80fd\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u673a\u5236\u6027\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Yet existing approaches break under exploration complexity and intent drift. We propose SEMA, a simple yet effective framework that trains a multi-turn attacker without relying on any existing strategies or external data. SEMA comprises two stages. Prefilling self-tuning enables usable rollouts by fine-tuning on non-refusal, well-structured, multi-turn adversarial prompts that are self-generated with a minimal prefix, thereby stabilizing subsequent learning. Reinforcement learning with intent-drift-aware reward trains the attacker to elicit valid multi-turn adversarial prompts while maintaining the same harmful objective. We anchor harmful intent in multi-turn jailbreaks via an intent-drift-aware reward that combines intent alignment, compliance risk, and level of detail. Our open-loop attack regime avoids dependence on victim feedback, unifies single- and multi-turn settings, and reduces exploration complexity. Across multiple datasets, victim models, and jailbreak judges, our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) attack success rates (ASR), outperforming all single-turn baselines, manually scripted and template-driven multi-turn baselines, as well as our SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) and DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) variants. For instance, SEMA performs an average $80.1\\%$ ASR@1 across three closed-source and open-source victim models on AdvBench, 33.9% over SOTA. The approach is compact, reproducible, and transfers across targets, providing a stronger and more realistic stress test for large language model (LLM) safety and enabling automatic redteaming to expose and localize failure modes.

We extend this analysis to clipped surrogate objectives used in modern alignment, demonstrating that the covariance law remains valid under mild conditions despite clipping.

Hallucinated outputs are constructed through a controlled editing process and validated by human annotators, ensuring clear alignment between original content and hallucinated generations. Using this dataset, we evaluate a diverse set of contemporary open-source and proprietary language models on fine-grained hallucination detection. Our results show that question answering is consistently easier than dialogue summarization, while sentence-level hallucinations remain challenging even for the strongest models. Performance is highest in English and degrades in lower-resource languages, with Hindi exhibiting the lowest detection accuracy. Overall, Halluverse-M^3 provides a realistic and challenging benchmark for studying hallucinations in multilingual, multi-task settings. We release the dataset to support future research on hallucination detection and mitigation\\footnote{https://huggingface.co/datasets/sabdalja/HalluVerse-M3}.", "AI": {"tldr": "Halluverse-M^3\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u591a\u5e7b\u89c9\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u4f9d\u7136\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u82f1\u8bed\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u3002\u9700\u8981\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86Halluverse-M^3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u82f1\u8bed\u3001\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u3001\u5370\u5730\u8bed\u548c\u571f\u8033\u5176\u8bed\u56db\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u95ee\u7b54\u548c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6458\u8981\u4e24\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u53d7\u63a7\u7f16\u8f91\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6784\u9020\u5e7b\u89c9\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5e76\u7531\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u539f\u59cb\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u5e7b\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6e05\u6670\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u6bd4\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6458\u8981\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\uff1b\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u5e7b\u89c9\u5bf9\u6700\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff1b\u82f1\u8bed\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5370\u5730\u8bed\uff09\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5e7b\u89c9\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "Halluverse-M^3\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Prior studies have explored tokenizer families and vocabulary sizes but typically (i) vary vocabulary without systematically controlling the tokenizer's training corpus, (ii) provide limited intrinsic diagnostics, and (iii) evaluate a narrow slice of downstream tasks. We present the first comprehensive, principled study of Turkish subword tokenization; a \"subwords manifest\", that jointly varies vocabulary size and tokenizer training corpus size (data and vocabulary coupling), compares multiple tokenizer families under matched parameter budgets (WordPiece, morphology level, and character baselines), and evaluates across semantic (NLI, STS, sentiment analysis, NER), syntactic (POS, dependency parsing), and morphology-sensitive probes. To explain why tokenizers succeed or fail, we introduce a morphology-aware diagnostic toolkit that goes beyond coarse aggregates to boundary-level micro/macro F1, decoupled lemma atomicity vs. surface boundary hits, over/under-segmentation indices, character/word edit distances (CER/WER), continuation rates, and affix-type coverage and token-level atomicity. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) a systematic investigation of the vocabulary-corpus-success triad; (ii) a unified, morphology-aware evaluation framework linking intrinsic diagnostics to extrinsic outcomes; (iii) controlled comparisons identifying when character-level and morphology-level tokenization pay off; and (iv) an open-source release of evaluation code, tokenizer pipelines, and models.

However, constrained by the quality--speed trade-off, existing inference solutions adopt conservative parallel strategies, leaving substantial efficiency potential underexplored. A core challenge is that parallel decoding assumes each position can be filled independently, but tokens are often semantically coupled. Thus, the correct choice at one position constrains valid choices at others. Without modeling these inter-token dependencies, parallel strategies produce deteriorated outputs. Motivated by this insight, we propose DAWN, a training-free, dependency-aware decoding method for fast dLLM inference. DAWN extracts token dependencies and leverages two key motivations: (1) positions dependent on unmasked certain positions become more reliable, (2) simultaneously unmasking strongly coupled uncertain positions induces errors. Given those findings, DAWN leverages a dependency graph to select more reliable unmasking positions at each iteration, achieving high parallelism with negligible loss in generation quality. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that DAWN speedups the inference by 1.80-8.06x over baselines while preserving the generation quality.

Experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B show that InftyThink+ improves accuracy by 21% on AIME24 and outperforms conventional long chain-of-thought reinforcement learning by a clear margin, while also generalizing better to out-of-distribution benchmarks. Moreover, InftyThink+ significantly reduces inference latency and accelerates reinforcement learning training, demonstrating improved reasoning efficiency alongside stronger performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "InftyThink+\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u8fed\u4ee3\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u63a8\u7406\u5b58\u5728\u4e8c\u6b21\u6210\u672c\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u548c\u4e2d\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6216\u56fa\u5b9a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u4f55\u65f6\u603b\u7ed3\u3001\u4fdd\u7559\u4ec0\u4e48\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u7ee7\u7eed\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faInftyThink+\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u603b\u7ed3\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\uff1a\u76d1\u7763\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u540e\u63a5\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u603b\u7ed3\u548c\u7ee7\u7eed\u63a8\u7406\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u5728DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B\u4e0a\uff0cInftyThink+\u5728AIME24\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u534721%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u957f\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6cdb\u5316\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "InftyThink+\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u8fed\u4ee3\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}
