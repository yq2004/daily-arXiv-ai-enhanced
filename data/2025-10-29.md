Abstract: In order for large language models to achieve true conversational continuity
and benefit from experiential learning, they need memory. While research has
focused on the development of complex memory systems, it remains unclear which
types of memory are most effective for long-context conversational tasks. We
present a systematic evaluation of memory-augmented methods using LoCoMo, a
benchmark of synthetic long-context dialogues annotated for question-answering
tasks that require diverse reasoning strategies. We analyse full-context
prompting, semantic memory through retrieval-augmented generation and agentic
memory, episodic memory through in-context learning, and procedural memory
through prompt optimization. Our findings show that memory-augmented approaches
reduce token usage by over 90% while maintaining competitive accuracy. Memory
architecture complexity should scale with model capability, with small
foundation models benefitting most from RAG, and strong instruction-tuned
reasoning model gaining from episodic learning through reflections and more
complex agentic semantic memory. In particular, episodic memory can help LLMs
recognise the limits of their own knowledge.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The pursuit of efficient Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to increasingly
complex techniques like extreme quantization and dynamic routing. While
individual benefits of these methods are well-documented, their compositional
effects remain poorly understood. This paper introduces BitSkip, a hybrid
architectural framework for systematically explor- ing these interactions.
Counter-intuitively, our findings reveal that a simple 8-bit quantized model
without Hadamard transform (BitSkip-V1) not only outperforms its more complex
4-bit and Hadamard-enhanced counterparts but also competes the full-precision
baseline in quality (perplexity of 1.13 vs 1.19) . The introduction of Hadamard
transforms, even at 8- bit precision, catastrophically degraded performance by
over 37,000%, tracing fundamental training instability. Our BitSkip-V1 recipe
demonstrates superior early-exit characteristics, with layer 18 providing
optimal 32.5% speed gain for minimal 4% quality loss.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of the ability of large language models
(LLMs) to process culturally grounded language, specifically to understand and
pragmatically use figurative expressions that encode local knowledge and
cultural nuance. Using figurative language as a proxy for cultural nuance and
local knowledge, we design evaluation tasks for contextual understanding,
pragmatic use, and connotation interpretation in Arabic and English. We
evaluate 22 open- and closed-source LLMs on Egyptian Arabic idioms,
multidialectal Arabic proverbs, and English proverbs. Our results show a
consistent hierarchy: the average accuracy for Arabic proverbs is 4.29% lower
than for English proverbs, and performance for Egyptian idioms is 10.28% lower
than for Arabic proverbs. For the pragmatic use task, accuracy drops by 14.07%
relative to understanding, though providing contextual idiomatic sentences
improves accuracy by 10.66%. Models also struggle with connotative meaning,
reaching at most 85.58% agreement with human annotators on idioms with 100%
inter-annotator agreement. These findings demonstrate that figurative language
serves as an effective diagnostic for cultural reasoning: while LLMs can often
interpret figurative meaning, they face challenges in using it appropriately.
To support future research, we release Kinayat, the first dataset of Egyptian
Arabic idioms designed for both figurative understanding and pragmatic use
evaluation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Most state-of-the-art sign language models are trained on interpreter or
isolated vocabulary data, which overlooks the variability that characterizes
natural dialogue. However, human communication dynamically adapts to contexts
and interlocutors through spatiotemporal changes and articulation style. This
specifically manifests itself in educational settings, where novel vocabularies
are used by teachers, and students. To address this gap, we collect a motion
capture dataset of American Sign Language (ASL) STEM (Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics) dialogue that enables quantitative comparison
between dyadic interactive signing, solo signed lecture, and interpreted
articles. Using continuous kinematic features, we disentangle dialogue-specific
entrainment from individual effort reduction and show spatiotemporal changes
across repeated mentions of STEM terms. On average, dialogue signs are
24.6%-44.6% shorter in duration than the isolated signs, and show significant
reductions absent in monologue contexts. Finally, we evaluate sign embedding
models on their ability to recognize STEM signs and approximate how entrained
the participants become over time. Our study bridges linguistic analysis and
computational modeling to understand how pragmatics shape sign articulation and
its representation in sign language technologies.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Detecting mental health crisis situations such as suicide ideation, rape,
domestic violence, child abuse, and sexual harassment is a critical yet
underexplored challenge for language models. When such situations arise during
user--model interactions, models must reliably flag them, as failure to do so
can have serious consequences. In this work, we introduce CRADLE BENCH, a
benchmark for multi-faceted crisis detection. Unlike previous efforts that
focus on a limited set of crisis types, our benchmark covers seven types
defined in line with clinical standards and is the first to incorporate
temporal labels. Our benchmark provides 600 clinician-annotated evaluation
examples and 420 development examples, together with a training corpus of
around 4K examples automatically labeled using a majority-vote ensemble of
multiple language models, which significantly outperforms single-model
annotation. We further fine-tune six crisis detection models on subsets defined
by consensus and unanimous ensemble agreement, providing complementary models
trained under different agreement criteria.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language model agents are increasingly used in multi-turn
conversational settings to interact with and execute tasks in dynamic
environments. However, a key limitation is their temporal blindness: they, by
default, operate with a stationary context, failing to account for the
real-world time elapsed between messages. This becomes a critical liability
when an agent must decide whether to invoke a tool based on how much time has
passed since the last observation. Without temporal awareness, agents often
either over-rely on previous context (skipping necessary tool calls), or
under-rely on it (unnecessarily repeating tool calls). To study this challenge,
we introduce TicToc-v1, a test set of multi-turn user-agent trajectories across
34 scenarios with varying time sensitivity. Each trajectory ends with a user
question, where the need for a tool call depends on the amount of time elapsed
since the last message. To give LLMs temporal context, we augment dialogue
messages with explicit timestamps, bridging the gap between static dialogue and
evolving environments. We then collected human preferences for these samples,
creating two subsets: one where humans preferred relying on the previous
observation (prefer-noTool), and another where they preferred a new tool call
(prefer-Tool). We evaluated how well LLM tool-calling decisions align with
human preferences under varying time intervals on TicToc-v1. Our analysis show
that without time information, most models perform only slightly better than
random, with the top alignment rate being just over 60%. While adding
timestamps leads to a slight improvement, particularly for larger models, the
improvement is modest, peaking at around 65%. We also show that naive,
prompt-based alignment have limited effectiveness. Our findings highlight the
need for specific post-training alignment to align multi-turn LLM tool use with
human temporal perception.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In modern industry systems like multi-turn chat agents, Text-to-SQL
technology bridges natural language (NL) questions and database (DB) querying.
The conversion of tabular DB results into NL representations (NLRs) enables the
chat-based interaction. Currently, NLR generation is typically handled by large
language models (LLMs), but information loss or errors in presenting tabular
results in NL remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a novel
evaluation method - Combo-Eval - for judgment of LLM-generated NLRs that
combines the benefits of multiple existing methods, optimizing evaluation
fidelity and achieving a significant reduction in LLM calls by 25-61%.
Accompanying our method is NLR-BIRD, the first dedicated dataset for NLR
benchmarking. Through human evaluations, we demonstrate the superior alignment
of Combo-Eval with human judgments, applicable across scenarios with and
without ground truth references.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present OraPlan-SQL, our system for the Archer NL2SQL Evaluation Challenge
2025, a bilingual benchmark requiring complex reasoning such as arithmetic,
commonsense, and hypothetical inference. OraPlan-SQL ranked first, exceeding
the second-best system by more than 6% in execution accuracy (EX), with 55.0%
in English and 56.7% in Chinese, while maintaining over 99% SQL validity (VA).
Our system follows an agentic framework with two components: Planner agent that
generates stepwise natural language plans, and SQL agent that converts these
plans into executable SQL. Since SQL agent reliably adheres to the plan, our
refinements focus on the planner. Unlike prior methods that rely on multiple
sub-agents for planning and suffer from orchestration overhead, we introduce a
feedback-guided meta-prompting strategy to refine a single planner. Failure
cases from a held-out set are clustered with human input, and an LLM distills
them into corrective guidelines that are integrated into the planner's system
prompt, improving generalization without added complexity. For the multilingual
scenario, to address transliteration and entity mismatch issues, we incorporate
entity-linking guidelines that generate alternative surface forms for entities
and explicitly include them in the plan. Finally, we enhance reliability
through plan diversification: multiple candidate plans are generated for each
query, with the SQL agent producing a query for each plan, and final output
selected via majority voting over their executions.

Abstract: Personalized text generation requires models not only to produce coherent
text but also to align with a target user's style, tone, and topical focus.
Existing retrieval-augmented approaches such as LaMP and PGraphRAG enrich
profiles with user and neighbor histories, but they stop at generation and
often yield outputs that drift in tone, topic, or style. We present PerFine, a
unified, training-free critique-refine framework that enhances personalization
through iterative, profile-grounded feedback. In each iteration, an LLM
generator produces a draft conditioned on the retrieved profile, and a critic
LLM - also conditioned on the same profile - provides structured feedback on
tone, vocabulary, sentence structure, and topicality. The generator then
revises, while a novel knockout strategy retains the stronger draft across
iterations. We further study additional inference-time strategies such as
Best-of-N and Topic Extraction to balance quality and efficiency. Across Yelp,
Goodreads, and Amazon datasets, PerFine consistently improves personalization
over PGraphRAG, with GEval gains of +7-13%, steady improvements over 3-5
refinement iterations, and scalability with increasing critic size. These
results highlight that post-hoc, profile-aware feedback offers a powerful
paradigm for personalized LLM generation that is both training-free and
model-agnostic.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Text embeddings are an essential building component of several NLP tasks such
as retrieval-augmented generation which is crucial for preventing
hallucinations in LLMs. Despite the recent release of massively multilingual
MTEB (MMTEB), African languages remain underrepresented, with existing tasks
often repurposed from translation benchmarks such as FLORES clustering or
SIB-200. In this paper, we introduce AfriMTEB -- a regional expansion of MMTEB
covering 59 languages, 14 tasks, and 38 datasets, including six newly added
datasets. Unlike many MMTEB datasets that include fewer than five languages,
the new additions span 14 to 56 African languages and introduce entirely new
tasks, such as hate speech detection, intent detection, and emotion
classification, which were not previously covered. Complementing this, we
present AfriE5, an adaptation of the instruction-tuned mE5 model to African
languages through cross-lingual contrastive distillation. Our evaluation shows
that AfriE5 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong
baselines such as Gemini-Embeddings and mE5.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) becomes increasingly widespread, the
role of information retrieval (IR) is shifting from retrieving information for
human users to retrieving contextual knowledge for artificial intelligence (AI)
systems, where relevance becomes difficult to define or annotate beforehand. To
address this challenge, we propose R3, a Retrieval framework optimized for RAG
through trialand-feedback Reinforced contrastive learning. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on annotated or synthetic data for supervised fine-tuning,
R3 enables the retriever to dynamically explore and optimize relevance within
the RAG environment. During training, the retrieved results interact with the
environment to produce contrastive signals that automatically guide the
retriever's self-improvement. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks
demonstrate that R3 improves RAG performance by 5.2% over the original
retriever and surpasses state-of-the-art retrievers by 4.9%, while achieving
comparable results to LLM-augmented retrieval and RAG systems built on
post-trained or instruction-tuned LLMs. It is both efficient and practical,
requiring only 4 GPUs and completing training within a single day.

Abstract: Large Language Models have been shown to demonstrate stereotypical biases in
their representations and behavior due to the discriminative nature of the data
that they have been trained on. Despite significant progress in the development
of methods and models that refrain from using stereotypical information in
their decision-making, recent work has shown that approaches used for bias
alignment are brittle. In this work, we introduce a novel and general
augmentation framework that involves three plug-and-play steps and is
applicable to a number of fairness evaluation benchmarks. Through application
of augmentation to a fairness evaluation dataset (Bias Benchmark for Question
Answering (BBQ)), we find that Large Language Models (LLMs), including
state-of-the-art open and closed weight models, are susceptible to
perturbations to their inputs, showcasing a higher likelihood to behave
stereotypically. Furthermore, we find that such models are more likely to have
biased behavior in cases where the target demographic belongs to a community
less studied by the literature, underlining the need to expand the fairness and
safety research to include more diverse communities.

Abstract: We present a novel agent-based approach for the automated claim matching task
with instruction-following LLMs. We propose a two-step pipeline that first
generates prompts with LLMs, to then perform claim matching as a binary
classification task with LLMs. We demonstrate that LLM-generated prompts can
outperform SOTA with human-generated prompts, and that smaller LLMs can do as
well as larger ones in the generation process, allowing to save computational
resources. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of using different LLMs for
each step of the pipeline, i.e. using an LLM for prompt generation, and another
for claim matching. Our investigation into the prompt generation process in
turn reveals insights into the LLMs' understanding of claim matching.

Abstract: We introduce a novel, training free cascade for auto-prompting Large Language
Models (LLMs) to assess product quality in e-commerce. Our system requires no
training labels or model fine-tuning, instead automatically generating and
refining prompts for evaluating attribute quality across tens of thousands of
product category-attribute pairs. Starting from a seed of human-crafted
prompts, the cascade progressively optimizes instructions to meet
catalog-specific requirements. This approach bridges the gap between general
language understanding and domain-specific knowledge at scale in complex
industrial catalogs. Our extensive empirical evaluations shows the auto-prompt
cascade improves precision and recall by $8-10\%$ over traditional
chain-of-thought prompting. Notably, it achieves these gains while reducing
domain expert effort from 5.1 hours to 3 minutes per attribute - a $99\%$
reduction. Additionally, the cascade generalizes effectively across five
languages and multiple quality assessment tasks, consistently maintaining
performance gains.

Abstract: There have been a couple of studies showing that attempting to erase
multilingual knowledge using only English data is insufficient for multilingual
LLMs. However, their analyses remain highly performance-oriented. In this
paper, we switch the point of view to evaluation, and address an additional
blind spot which reveals itself when the multilingual LLM is fully finetuned
with parallel multilingual dataset before unlearning. Here, language confusion
occurs whereby a model responds in language different from that of the input
prompt. Language confusion is a problematic phenomenon in unlearning, causing
the standard reference-based metrics to fail. We tackle this phenomenon in
three steps: (1) introduce N-gram-based Language-Mix (N-Mix) score to
quantitatively show the language confusion is pervasive and consistent in
multilingual LLMs, (2) demonstrate that reference-based metrics result in false
negatives when N-Mix score is high, and(3) suggest the need of new type of
unlearning evaluation that can directly assess the content of the generated
sentences. We call this type of metrics as semantic-based metric.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated potential in enhancing
medical question-answering systems through the integration of large language
models (LLMs) with external medical literature. LLMs can retrieve relevant
medical articles to generate more professional responses efficiently. However,
current RAG applications still face problems. They generate incorrect
information, such as hallucinations, and they fail to use external knowledge
correctly. To solve these issues, we propose a new method named M-Eval. This
method is inspired by the heterogeneity analysis approach used in
Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM). Our approach can check for factual errors in RAG
responses using evidence from multiple sources. First, we extract additional
medical literature from external knowledge bases. Then, we retrieve the
evidence documents generated by the RAG system. We use heterogeneity analysis
to check whether the evidence supports different viewpoints in the response. In
addition to verifying the accuracy of the response, we also assess the
reliability of the evidence provided by the RAG system. Our method shows an
improvement of up to 23.31% accuracy across various LLMs. This work can help
detect errors in current RAG-based medical systems. It also makes the
applications of LLMs more reliable and reduces diagnostic errors.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Evidence-based medicine (EBM) research has always been of paramount
importance. It is important to find appropriate medical theoretical support for
the needs from physicians or patients to reduce the occurrence of medical
accidents. This process is often carried out by human querying relevant
literature databases, which lacks objectivity and efficiency. Therefore,
researchers utilize retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to search for evidence
and generate responses automatically. However, current RAG methods struggle to
handle complex queries in real-world clinical scenarios. For example, when
queries lack certain information or use imprecise language, the model may
retrieve irrelevant evidence and generate unhelpful answers. To address this
issue, we present the PICOs-RAG to expand the user queries into a better
format. Our method can expand and normalize the queries into professional ones
and use the PICO format, a search strategy tool present in EBM, to extract the
most important information used for retrieval. This approach significantly
enhances retrieval efficiency and relevance, resulting in up to an 8.8\%
improvement compared to the baseline evaluated by our method. Thereby the
PICOs-RAG improves the performance of the large language models into a helpful
and reliable medical assistant in EBM.

Abstract: Evidence-based medicine (EBM) holds a crucial role in clinical application.
Given suitable medical articles, doctors effectively reduce the incidence of
misdiagnoses. Researchers find it efficient to use large language models (LLMs)
techniques like RAG for EBM tasks. However, the EBM maintains stringent
requirements for evidence, and RAG applications in EBM struggle to efficiently
distinguish high-quality evidence. Therefore, inspired by the meta-analysis
used in EBM, we provide a new method to re-rank and filter the medical
evidence. This method presents multiple principles to filter the best evidence
for LLMs to diagnose. We employ a combination of several EBM methods to emulate
the meta-analysis, which includes reliability analysis, heterogeneity analysis,
and extrapolation analysis. These processes allow the users to retrieve the
best medical evidence for the LLMs. Ultimately, we evaluate these high-quality
articles and show an accuracy improvement of up to 11.4% in our experiments and
results. Our method successfully enables RAG to extract higher-quality and more
reliable evidence from the PubMed dataset. This work can reduce the infusion of
incorrect knowledge into responses and help users receive more effective
replies.

Abstract: The task of information extraction (IE) is to extract structured knowledge
from text. However, it is often not straightforward to utilize IE output due to
the mismatch between the IE ontology and the downstream application needs. We
propose a new formulation of IE TEXT2DB that emphasizes the integration of IE
output and the target database (or knowledge base). Given a user instruction, a
document set, and a database, our task requires the model to update the
database with values from the document set to satisfy the user instruction.
This task requires understanding user instructions for what to extract and
adapting to the given DB/KB schema for how to extract on the fly. To evaluate
this new task, we introduce a new benchmark featuring common demands such as
data infilling, row population, and column addition. In addition, we propose an
LLM agent framework OPAL (Observe-PlanAnalyze LLM) which includes an Observer
component that interacts with the database, the Planner component that
generates a code-based plan with calls to IE models, and the Analyzer component
that provides feedback regarding code quality before execution. Experiments
show that OPAL can successfully adapt to diverse database schemas by generating
different code plans and calling the required IE models. We also highlight
difficult cases such as dealing with large databases with complex dependencies
and extraction hallucination, which we believe deserve further investigation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for
their reliable deployment. Existing methods typically fine-tune LLMs to abstain
from answering questions beyond their knowledge scope. However, these methods
often rely on coarse-grained signals to guide LLMs to abstain, such as overall
confidence or uncertainty scores on multiple sampled answers, which may result
in an imprecise awareness of the model's own knowledge boundaries. To this end,
we propose a novel reinforcement learning framework built on
$\textbf{\underline{Fi}ne-grained \underline{S}emantic \underline{Co}nfidence
\underline{Re}ward (\Ours)}$, which guides LLMs to abstain via sample-specific
confidence. Specifically, our method operates by sampling multiple candidate
answers and conducting semantic clustering, then training the LLM to retain
answers within high-confidence clusters and discard those within low-confidence
ones, thereby promoting accurate post-hoc abstention. Additionally, we propose
a new metric for evaluating the reliability of abstention fine-tuning tasks
more comprehensively. Our method significantly enhances reliability in both
in-domain and out-of-distribution benchmarks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has become a cornerstone technique for
compressing Large Language Models (LLMs) into smaller, more efficient student
models. However, conventional KD approaches typically apply the distillation
loss uniformly across all tokens, regardless of the teacher's confidence. This
indiscriminate mimicry can introduce noise, as the student is forced to learn
from the teacher's uncertain or high-entropy predictions, which may ultimately
harm student performance-especially when the teacher is much larger and more
powerful. To address this, we propose Speculative Knowledge Distillation
(SpecKD), a novel, plug-and-play framework that introduces a dynamic,
token-level gating mechanism inspired by the "propose-and-verify" paradigm of
speculative decoding. At each step, the student's token proposal is verified
against the teacher's distribution; the distillation loss is selectively
applied only to "accepted" tokens, while "rejected" tokens are masked out.
Extensive experiments on diverse text generation tasks show that SpecKD
consistently and significantly outperforms strong KD baselines, leading to more
stable training and more capable student models, and achieving state-of-the-art
results.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Humans leverage shared conversational context to become increasingly
successful and efficient at communicating over time. One manifestation of this
is the formation of ad hoc linguistic conventions, which allow people to
coordinate on short, less costly utterances that are understood using shared
conversational context. We present a method to train large multimodal models to
form conventions, enabling efficient communication. Our approach uses simulated
reference games between models, and requires no additional human-produced data.
In repeated reference games involving photographs and tangram images, our
method enables models to communicate efficiently with people: reducing the
message length by up to 41% while increasing success by 15% over the course of
the interaction. Human listeners respond faster when interacting with our model
that forms conventions. We also show that training based on success or cost
alone is insufficient - both are necessary to elicit convention formation.

Abstract: Emerging large language model (LLM) applications involve diverse reasoning
strategies and agentic workflows, straining the capabilities of existing
serving systems built on a monolithic token generation loop. This paper
introduces Pie, a programmable LLM serving system designed for flexibility and
efficiency. Pie decomposes the traditional generation loop into fine-grained
service handlers exposed via an API and delegates control of the generation
process to user-provided programs, called inferlets. This enables applications
to implement new KV cache strategies, bespoke generation logic, and seamlessly
integrate computation and I/O-entirely within the application, without
requiring modifications to the serving system. Pie executes inferlets using
WebAssembly, benefiting from its lightweight sandboxing. Our evaluation shows
Pie matches state-of-the-art performance on standard tasks (3-12% latency
overhead) while significantly improving latency and throughput (1.3x-3.4x
higher) on agentic workflows by enabling application-specific optimizations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced machine translation but remain
vulnerable to hallucinations. Unfortunately, existing MT benchmarks are not
capable of exposing failures in multilingual LLMs. To disclose hallucination in
multilingual LLMs, we introduce a diagnostic framework with a taxonomy that
separates Instruction Detachment from Source Detachment. Guided by this
taxonomy, we create HalloMTBench, a multilingual, human-verified benchmark
across 11 English-to-X directions. We employed 4 frontier LLMs to generate
candidates and scrutinize these candidates with an ensemble of LLM judges, and
expert validation. In this way, we curate 5,435 high-quality instances. We have
evaluated 17 LLMs on HalloMTBench. Results reveal distinct ``hallucination
triggers'' -- unique failure patterns reflecting model scale, source length
sensitivity, linguistic biases, and Reinforcement-Learning (RL) amplified
language mixing. HalloMTBench offers a forward-looking testbed for diagnosing
LLM translation failures. HalloMTBench is available in

Abstract: To date, there exist almost no culturally-specific evaluation benchmarks for
large language models (LLMs) that cover a large number of languages and
cultures. In this paper, we present Global PIQA, a participatory commonsense
reasoning benchmark for over 100 languages, constructed by hand by 335
researchers from 65 countries around the world. The 116 language varieties in
Global PIQA cover five continents, 14 language families, and 23 writing
systems. In the non-parallel split of Global PIQA, over 50% of examples
reference local foods, customs, traditions, or other culturally-specific
elements. We find that state-of-the-art LLMs perform well on Global PIQA in
aggregate, but they exhibit weaker performance in lower-resource languages (up
to a 37% accuracy gap, despite random chance at 50%). Open models generally
perform worse than proprietary models. Global PIQA highlights that in many
languages and cultures, everyday knowledge remains an area for improvement,
alongside more widely-discussed capabilities such as complex reasoning and
expert knowledge. Beyond its uses for LLM evaluation, we hope that Global PIQA
provides a glimpse into the wide diversity of cultures in which human language
is embedded.

Abstract: The Bengali language, spoken extensively across South Asia and among
diasporic communities, exhibits considerable dialectal diversity shaped by
geography, culture, and history. Phonological and pronunciation-based
classifications broadly identify five principal dialect groups: Eastern
Bengali, Manbhumi, Rangpuri, Varendri, and Rarhi. Within Bangladesh, further
distinctions emerge through variation in vocabulary, syntax, and morphology, as
observed in regions such as Chittagong, Sylhet, Rangpur, Rajshahi, Noakhali,
and Barishal. Despite this linguistic richness, systematic research on the
computational processing of Bengali dialects remains limited. This study seeks
to document and analyze the phonetic and morphological properties of these
dialects while exploring the feasibility of building computational models
particularly Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems tailored to regional
varieties. Such efforts hold potential for applications in virtual assistants
and broader language technologies, contributing to both the preservation of
dialectal diversity and the advancement of inclusive digital tools for
Bengali-speaking communities. The dataset created for this study is released
for public use.

Experiments on widely adopted benchmarks demonstrate that the collaborative
workflows consistently outperform the original individual methods, thereby
opening up a new effective avenue for tackling complex real-world queries. The

Abstract: While traditional line-level filtering techniques, such as line-level

enhancing the conventional filtering techniques. Our approach not only
considers line-level signals but also takes into account their sequential
distribution across documents, enabling us to retain structurally important
content that might otherwise be removed. We evaluate these proposed methods by
training small language models (1 B parameters) in both English and Korean. The
results demonstrate that our methods consistently improve performance on
multiple-choice benchmarks and significantly enhance generative

Abstract: Sarcasm is a complex form of figurative language in which the intended
meaning contradicts the literal one. Its prevalence in social media and popular
culture poses persistent challenges for natural language understanding,
sentiment analysis, and content moderation. With the emergence of multimodal
large language models, sarcasm detection extends beyond text and requires
integrating cues from audio and vision. We present MuSaG, the first German
multimodal sarcasm detection dataset, consisting of 33 minutes of manually
selected and human-annotated statements from German television shows. Each
instance provides aligned text, audio, and video modalities, annotated
separately by humans, enabling evaluation in unimodal and multimodal settings.
We benchmark nine open-source and commercial models, spanning text, audio,
vision, and multimodal architectures, and compare their performance to human
annotations. Our results show that while humans rely heavily on audio in
conversational settings, models perform best on text. This highlights a gap in
current multimodal models and motivates the use of MuSaG for developing models
better suited to realistic scenarios. We release MuSaG publicly to support
future research on multimodal sarcasm detection and human-model alignment.

Abstract: This paper explores the influence of external knowledge integration in
Natural Language Generation (NLG), focusing on a commonsense generation task.
We extend the CommonGen dataset by creating KITGI, a benchmark that pairs input
concept sets with retrieved semantic relations from ConceptNet and includes
manually annotated outputs. Using the T5-Large model, we compare sentence
generation under two conditions: with full external knowledge and with filtered
knowledge where highly relevant relations were deliberately removed. Our
interpretability benchmark follows a three-stage method: (1) identifying and
removing key knowledge, (2) regenerating sentences, and (3) manually assessing
outputs for commonsense plausibility and concept coverage. Results show that
sentences generated with full knowledge achieved 91\% correctness across both
criteria, while filtering reduced performance drastically to 6\%. These
findings demonstrate that relevant external knowledge is critical for
maintaining both coherence and concept coverage in NLG. This work highlights
the importance of designing interpretable, knowledge-enhanced NLG systems and
calls for evaluation frameworks that capture the underlying reasoning beyond
surface-level metrics.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of knowledge in their
massive parameters, which is accessible to locate, trace, and analyze. Despite
advances in neural interpretability, it is still not clear how to transfer
knowledge in a fine-grained manner, namely parametric knowledge transfer (PKT).
A key problem is enabling effective and efficient knowledge transfer across
LLMs of different scales, which is essential for achieving greater flexibility
and broader applicability in transferring knowledge between LLMs. Due to neural
incompatibility, referring to the architectural and parametric differences
between LLMs of varying scales, existing methods that directly reuse layer
parameters are severely limited. In this paper, we identify the semantic
alignment in latent space as the fundamental prerequisite for LLM cross-scale
knowledge transfer. Instead of directly using the layer parameters, our
approach takes activations as the medium of layer-wise knowledge transfer.
Leveraging the semantics in latent space, our approach is simple and
outperforms prior work, better aligning model behaviors across varying scales.
Evaluations on four benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our method. Further
analysis reveals the key factors easing cross-scale knowledge transfer and
provides insights into the nature of latent semantic alignment.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Hallucinations in LLMs present a critical barrier to their reliable usage.
Existing research usually categorizes hallucination by their external
properties rather than by the LLMs' underlying internal properties. This
external focus overlooks that hallucinations may require tailored mitigation
strategies based on their underlying mechanism. We propose a framework for
categorizing hallucinations along two axes: knowledge and certainty. Since
parametric knowledge and certainty may vary across models, our categorization
method involves a model-specific dataset construction process that
differentiates between those types of hallucinations. Along the knowledge axis,
we distinguish between hallucinations caused by a lack of knowledge and those
occurring despite the model having the knowledge of the correct response. To
validate our framework along the knowledge axis, we apply steering mitigation,
which relies on the existence of parametric knowledge to manipulate model
activations. This addresses the lack of existing methods to validate knowledge
categorization by showing a significant difference between the two
hallucination types. We further analyze the distinct knowledge and
hallucination patterns between models, showing that different hallucinations do
occur despite shared parametric knowledge. Turning to the certainty axis, we
identify a particularly concerning subset of hallucinations where models
hallucinate with certainty despite having the correct knowledge internally. We
introduce a new evaluation metric to measure the effectiveness of mitigation
methods on this subset, revealing that while some methods perform well on
average, they fail disproportionately on these critical cases. Our findings
highlight the importance of considering both knowledge and certainty in
hallucination analysis and call for targeted mitigation approaches that

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce explanations that do not
faithfully reflect the factors driving their predictions. In healthcare
settings, such unfaithfulness is especially problematic: explanations that omit
salient clinical cues or mask spurious shortcuts can undermine clinician trust
and lead to unsafe decision support. We study how inference and training-time
choices shape explanation faithfulness, focusing on factors practitioners can
control at deployment. We evaluate three LLMs (GPT-4.1-mini, LLaMA 70B, LLaMA
8B) on two datasets-BBQ (social bias) and MedQA (medical licensing questions),
and manipulate the number and type of few-shot examples, prompting strategies,
and training procedure. Our results show: (i) both the quantity and quality of
few-shot examples significantly impact model faithfulness; (ii) faithfulness is
sensitive to prompting design; (iii) the instruction-tuning phase improves
measured faithfulness on MedQA. These findings offer insights into strategies
for enhancing the interpretability and trustworthiness of LLMs in sensitive
domains.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the Diacritic Restoration (DR) task for Arabic
dialectal sentences using a multimodal approach that combines both textual and
speech information. We propose a model that represents the text modality using
an encoder extracted from our own pre-trained model named CATT. The speech
component is handled by the encoder module of the OpenAI Whisper base model.
Our solution is designed following two integration strategies. The former
consists of fusing the speech tokens with the input at an early stage, where
the 1500 frames of the audio segment are averaged over 10 consecutive frames,
resulting in 150 speech tokens. To ensure embedding compatibility, these
averaged tokens are processed through a linear projection layer prior to
merging them with the text tokens. Contextual encoding is guaranteed by the
CATT encoder module. The latter strategy relies on cross-attention, where text
and speech embeddings are fused. The cross-attention output is then fed to the
CATT classification head for token-level diacritic prediction. To further
improve model robustness, we randomly deactivate the speech input during
training, allowing the model to perform well with or without speech. Our
experiments show that the proposed approach achieves a word error rate (WER) of
0.25 and a character error rate (CER) of 0.9 on the development set. On the
test set, our model achieved WER and CER scores of 0.55 and 0.13, respectively.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), predominantly trained on adult conversational
data, face significant challenges when generating authentic, child-like
dialogue for specialized applications. We present a comparative study
evaluating five different LLMs (GPT-4, RUTER-LLAMA-2-13b, GPTSW, NorMistral-7b,
and NorBloom-7b) to generate age-appropriate Norwegian conversations for
children aged 5 and 9 years. Through a blind evaluation by eleven education
professionals using both real child interview data and LLM-generated text
samples, we assessed authenticity and developmental appropriateness. Our
results show that evaluators achieved strong inter-rater reliability (ICC=0.75)
and demonstrated higher accuracy in age prediction for younger children
(5-year-olds) compared to older children (9-year-olds). While GPT-4 and
NorBloom-7b performed relatively well, most models generated language perceived
as more linguistically advanced than the target age groups. These findings
highlight critical data-related challenges in developing LLM systems for
specialized applications involving children, particularly in low-resource
languages where comprehensive age-appropriate lexical resources are scarce.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We characterize how memorization is represented in transformer models and
show that it can be disentangled in the weights of both language models (LMs)
and vision transformers (ViTs) using a decomposition based on the loss
landscape curvature. This insight is based on prior theoretical and empirical
work showing that the curvature for memorized training points is much sharper
than non memorized, meaning ordering weight components from high to low
curvature can reveal a distinction without explicit labels. This motivates a
weight editing procedure that suppresses far more recitation of untargeted
memorized data more effectively than a recent unlearning method
(BalancedSubnet), while maintaining lower perplexity. Since the basis of
curvature has a natural interpretation for shared structure in model weights,
we analyze the editing procedure extensively on its effect on downstream tasks
in LMs, and find that fact retrieval and arithmetic are specifically and
consistently negatively affected, even though open book fact retrieval and
general logical reasoning is conserved. We posit these tasks rely heavily on
specialized directions in weight space rather than general purpose mechanisms,
regardless of whether those individual datapoints are memorized. We support
this by showing a correspondence between task data's activation strength with
low curvature components that we edit out, and the drop in task performance
after the edit. Our work enhances the understanding of memorization in neural
networks with practical applications towards removing it, and provides evidence
for idiosyncratic, narrowly-used structures involved in solving tasks like math
and fact retrieval.

Abstract: Emergent symbolic representations are critical for enabling developmental
learning agents to plan and generalize across tasks. In this work, we
investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can translate human natural
language instructions into the internal symbolic representations that emerge
during hierarchical reinforcement learning. We apply a structured evaluation
framework to measure the translation performance of commonly seen LLMs -- GPT,
Claude, Deepseek and Grok -- across different internal symbolic partitions
generated by a hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm in the Ant Maze
and Ant Fall environments. Our findings reveal that although LLMs demonstrate
some ability to translate natural language into a symbolic representation of
the environment dynamics, their performance is highly sensitive to partition
granularity and task complexity. The results expose limitations in current LLMs
capacity for representation alignment, highlighting the need for further
research on robust alignment between language and internal agent
representations.

Abstract: In recent years, many generalization benchmarks have shown language models'
lack of robustness in natural language inference (NLI). However, manually
creating new benchmarks is costly, while automatically generating high-quality
ones, even by modifying existing benchmarks, is extremely difficult. In this
paper, we propose a methodology for automatically generating high-quality
variants of original NLI problems by replacing open-class words, while
crucially preserving their underlying reasoning. We dub our generalization test
as MERGE (Minimal Expression-Replacements GEneralization), which evaluates the
correctness of models' predictions across reasoning-preserving variants of the
original problem. Our results show that NLI models' perform 4-20% worse on
variants, suggesting low generalizability even on such minimally altered
problems. We also analyse how word class of the replacements, word probability,
and plausibility influence NLI models' performance.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), particularly with
algorithms like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has proven highly
effective in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models.
However, a critical bottleneck in current pipelines lies in the limited
diversity of sampled trajectories during group rollouts. Homogeneous
trajectories and their associated rewards would diminish the return signals for
policy updates, thereby hindering effective policy learning. This lack of
diversity stems primarily from token-level stochastic sampling, where local
variations are likely to collapse into near-identical reasoning paths. To
address this limitation, we propose Lookahead Tree-Based Rollouts (LATR), a
novel rollout strategy designed to explicitly promotes trajectory-level
diversity by enforcing branching into different candidate tokens likely to
yield distinct continuations. Specifically, LATR iteratively operates in three
stages: (1) branching at high-uncertainty generation steps, (2) performing
lookahead simulation for each new branch, and (3) pruning branches that
exhibits prolonged similarity during simulation. Compared with stochastic
Sampling, LATR accelerates policy learning by 131% on average and improves
final pass@1 performance by 4.2% on both GRPO and Dynamic sAmpling Policy
Optimization (DAPO) algorithms across different reasoning tasks. Our code and
data are publicly available at https://github.com/starreeze/latr.

Abstract: Training critiquing language models to assess and provide feedback on model
outputs is a promising way to improve LLMs for complex reasoning tasks.
However, existing approaches typically rely on stronger supervisors for
annotating critique data. To address this, we propose Critique-RL, an online RL
approach for developing critiquing language models without stronger
supervision. Our approach operates on a two-player paradigm: the actor
generates a response, the critic provides feedback, and the actor refines the
response accordingly. We first reveal that relying solely on indirect reward
signals from the actor's outputs for RL optimization often leads to
unsatisfactory critics: while their helpfulness (i.e., providing constructive
feedback) improves, the discriminability (i.e., determining whether a response
is high-quality or not) remains poor, resulting in marginal performance gains.
To overcome this, Critique-RL adopts a two-stage optimization strategy. In
stage I, it reinforces the discriminability of the critic with direct
rule-based reward signals; in stage II, it introduces indirect rewards based on
actor refinement to improve the critic's helpfulness, while maintaining its
discriminability via appropriate regularization. Extensive experiments across
various tasks and models show that Critique-RL delivers substantial performance
improvements. For example, it achieves a 9.02% gain on in-domain tasks and a
5.70% gain on out-of-domain tasks for Qwen2.5-7B, highlighting its potential.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to answer everyday
questions, yet their performance on culturally grounded and dialectal content
remains uneven across languages. We propose a comprehensive method that (i)
translates Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) multiple-choice questions (MCQs) into
English and several Arabic dialects, (ii) converts them into open-ended
questions (OEQs), (iii) benchmarks a range of zero-shot and fine-tuned LLMs
under both MCQ and OEQ settings, and (iv) generates chain-of-thought (CoT)
rationales to fine-tune models for step-by-step reasoning. Using this method,
we extend an existing dataset in which QAs are parallelly aligned across
multiple language varieties, making it, to our knowledge, the first of its
kind. We conduct extensive experiments with both open and closed models. Our
findings show that (i) models underperform on Arabic dialects, revealing
persistent gaps in culturally grounded and dialect-specific knowledge; (ii)
Arabic-centric models perform well on MCQs but struggle with OEQs; and (iii)
CoT improves judged correctness while yielding mixed n-gram-based metrics. The
developed dataset will be publicly released to support further research on
culturally and linguistically inclusive evaluation.

Abstract: Generating long, informative, and factual outputs remains a major challenge
for Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing benchmarks for long-form generation
typically assess real-world queries with hard-to-verify metrics or use
synthetic setups that ease evaluation but overlook real-world intricacies. In
this paper, we introduce \textbf{LongWeave}, which balances real-world and
verifiable assessment with Constraint-Verifier Evaluation (CoV-Eval). CoV-Eval
constructs tasks by first defining verifiable targets within real-world
scenarios, then systematically generating corresponding queries, textual
materials, and constraints based on these targets. This ensures that tasks are
both realistic and objectively assessable, enabling rigorous assessment of
model capabilities in meeting complex real-world constraints. LongWeave
supports customizable input/output lengths (up to 64K/8K tokens) across seven
distinct tasks. Evaluation on 23 LLMs shows that even state-of-the-art models
encounter significant challenges in long-form generation as real-world
complexity and output length increase.

Abstract: Sentence embeddings can be decoded to give approximations of the original
texts used to create them. We explore this effect in the context of text
simplification, demonstrating that reconstructed text embeddings preserve
complexity levels. We experiment with a small feed forward neural network to
effectively learn a transformation between sentence embeddings representing
high-complexity and low-complexity texts. We provide comparison to a Seq2Seq
and LLM-based approach, showing encouraging results in our much smaller
learning setting. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our
transformation to an unseen simplification dataset (MedEASI), as well as
datasets from languages outside the training data (ES,DE). We conclude that
learning transformations in sentence embedding space is a promising direction
for future research and has potential to unlock the ability to develop small,
but powerful models for text simplification and other natural language
generation tasks.

Abstract: Recent efforts leverage knowledge distillation techniques to develop
lightweight and practical sentiment analysis models. These methods are grounded
in human-written instructions and large-scale user texts. Despite the promising
results, two key challenges remain: (1) manually written instructions are
limited in diversity and quantity, making them insufficient to ensure
comprehensive coverage of distilled knowledge; (2) large-scale user texts incur
high computational cost, hindering the practicality of these methods. To this
end, we introduce COMPEFFDIST, a comprehensive and efficient distillation
framework for sentiment analysis. Our framework consists of two key modules:
attribute-based automatic instruction construction and difficulty-based data
filtering, which correspondingly tackle the aforementioned challenges. Applying
our method across multiple model series (Llama-3, Qwen-3, and Gemma-3), we
enable 3B student models to match the performance of 20x larger teacher models
on most tasks. In addition, our approach greatly outperforms baseline methods
in data efficiency, attaining the same performance level with only 10% of the
data.

Abstract: Evaluating the reasoning ability of language models (LMs) is complicated by
their extensive parametric world knowledge, where benchmark performance often
reflects factual recall rather than genuine reasoning. Existing datasets and
approaches (e.g., temporal filtering, paraphrasing, adversarial substitution)
cannot cleanly separate the two. We present SynthWorlds, a framework that
disentangles task reasoning complexity from factual knowledge. In SynthWorlds,
we construct parallel corpora representing two worlds with identical
interconnected structure: a real-mapped world, where models may exploit
parametric knowledge, and a synthetic-mapped world, where such knowledge is
meaningless. On top of these corpora, we design two mirrored tasks as case
studies: multi-hop question answering and page navigation, which maintain equal
reasoning difficulty across worlds. Experiments in parametric-only (e.g.,
closed-book QA) and knowledge-augmented (e.g., retrieval-augmented) LM settings
reveal a persistent knowledge advantage gap, defined as the performance boost
models gain from memorized parametric world knowledge. Knowledge acquisition
and integration mechanisms reduce but do not eliminate this gap, highlighting
opportunities for system improvements. Fully automatic and scalable,
SynthWorlds provides a controlled environment for evaluating LMs in ways that
were previously challenging, enabling precise and testable comparisons of
reasoning and memorization.

DeepSeek-R1-0528, chosen for its shown proficiency in Luxembourgish. Following
generation, we apply a quality assurance process, employing an LLM-as-a-judge
approach. To investigate the practical utility of the dataset, we fine-tune
several smaller-scale LLMs on LuxIT. Subsequent benchmarking against their base
models on Luxembourgish language proficiency examinations, however, yields
mixed results, with performance varying significantly across different models.
LuxIT represents a critical contribution to Luxembourgish natural language
processing and offers a replicable monolingual methodology, though our findings

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for Islamic guidance, but risk

on prompts from authentic Islamic blogs. Our dual-agent framework uses a
quantitative agent for citation verification and six-dimensional scoring (e.g.,
Structure, Islamic Consistency, Citations) and a qualitative agent for
five-dimensional side-by-side comparison (e.g., Tone, Depth, Originality).
GPT-4o scored highest in Islamic Accuracy (3.93) and Citation (3.38), Ansari AI
followed (3.68, 3.32), and Fanar lagged (2.76, 1.82). Despite relatively strong
performance, models still fall short in reliably producing accurate Islamic
content and citations -- a paramount requirement in faith-sensitive writing.
GPT-4o had the highest mean quantitative score (3.90/5), while Ansari AI led
qualitative pairwise wins (116/200). Fanar, though trailing, introduces
innovations for Islamic and Arabic contexts. This study underscores the need
for community-driven benchmarks centering Muslim perspectives, offering an
early step toward more reliable AI in Islamic knowledge and other high-stakes

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
in vision-language tasks such as reasoning segmentation, where models generate
segmentation masks based on textual queries. While prior work has primarily
focused on perturbing image inputs, semantically equivalent textual
paraphrases-crucial in real-world applications where users express the same
intent in varied ways-remain underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a
novel adversarial paraphrasing task: generating grammatically correct
paraphrases that preserve the original query meaning while degrading
segmentation performance. To evaluate the quality of adversarial paraphrases,
we develop a comprehensive automatic evaluation protocol validated with human
studies. Furthermore, we introduce SPARTA-a black-box, sentence-level
optimization method that operates in the low-dimensional semantic latent space
of a text autoencoder, guided by reinforcement learning. SPARTA achieves
significantly higher success rates, outperforming prior methods by up to 2x on
both the ReasonSeg and LLMSeg-40k datasets. We use SPARTA and competitive
baselines to assess the robustness of advanced reasoning segmentation models.
We reveal that they remain vulnerable to adversarial paraphrasing-even under
strict semantic and grammatical constraints. All code and data will be released
publicly upon acceptance.

containing 6,279 talks and 43,429 cited papers (26 per talk on average), where
relevance is approximated by the papers cited in the talk's corresponding
source publication. We establish strong baselines by evaluating
state-of-the-art text embedding models in zero-shot retrieval scenarios, and
propose a dual-encoder architecture trained on Talk2Ref. We further explore
strategies for handling long transcripts, as well as training for domain
adaptation. Our results show that fine-tuning on Talk2Ref significantly

Abstract: As Large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into our
lives, their inherent social biases remain a pressing concern. Detecting and
evaluating these biases can be challenging because they are often implicit
rather than explicit in nature, so developing evaluation methods that assess
the implicit knowledge representations of LLMs is essential. We present a novel
word association network methodology for evaluating implicit biases in LLMs
based on simulating semantic priming within LLM-generated word association
networks. Our prompt-based approach taps into the implicit relational
structures encoded in LLMs, providing both quantitative and qualitative
assessments of bias. Unlike most prompt-based evaluation methods, our method
enables direct comparisons between various LLMs and humans, providing a
valuable point of reference and offering new insights into the alignment of
LLMs with human cognition. To demonstrate the utility of our methodology, we
apply it to both humans and several widely used LLMs to investigate social
biases related to gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and
political party. Our results reveal both convergences and divergences between
LLM and human biases, providing new perspectives on the potential risks of
using LLMs. Our methodology contributes to a systematic, scalable, and
generalizable framework for evaluating and comparing biases across multiple
LLMs and humans, advancing the goal of transparent and socially responsible
language technologies.

often fail to capture the reasoning needed for accurate confidence assessment.
We propose natural language critiques as a solution, ideally suited for
confidence calibration, as precise gold confidence labels are hard to obtain
and often require multiple generations. This paper studies how natural language
critiques can enhance verbalized confidence, addressing: (1) What to critique:
uncertainty (question-focused) or confidence (answer-specific)? Analysis shows
confidence suits multiple-choice tasks, while uncertainty excels in open-ended
scenarios. (2) How to critique: self-critique or critique calibration training?
We propose Self-Critique, enabling LLMs to critique and optimize their
confidence beyond mere accuracy, and CritiCal, a novel Critique Calibration
training method that leverages natural language critiques to improve confidence
calibration, moving beyond direct numerical optimization. Experiments show that
CritiCal significantly outperforms Self-Critique and other competitive
baselines, even surpassing its teacher model, GPT-4o, in complex reasoning
tasks. CritiCal also shows robust generalization in out-of-distribution
settings, advancing LLM's reliability.

Abstract: Many words are ambiguous in terms of their part of speech (POS). However,
when a word appears in a text, this ambiguity is generally much reduced.
Disambiguating POS involves using context to reduce the number of POS
associated with words, and is one of the main challenges of lexical tagging.
The problem of labeling words by POS frequently arises in natural language
processing, for example for spelling correction, grammar or style checking,
expression recognition, text-to-speech conversion, text corpus analysis, etc.
Lexical tagging systems are thus useful as an initial component of many natural
language processing systems. A number of recent lexical tagging systems produce
multiple solutions when the text is lexically ambiguous or the uniquely correct
solution cannot be found. These contributions aim to guarantee a zero silence
rate: the correct tag(s) for a word must never be discarded. This objective is
unrealistic for systems that tag each word uniquely. This article concerns a
lexical disambiguation method adapted to the objective of a zero silence rate
and implemented in Silberztein's INTEX system (1993). We present here a formal
description of this method. We show that to verify a local disambiguation
grammar in this framework, it is not sufficient to consider the transducer
paths separately: one needs to verify their interactions. Similarly, if a
combination of multiple transducers is used, the result cannot be predicted by
considering them in isolation. Furthermore, when examining the initial labeling
of a text as produced by INTEX, ideas for disambiguation rules come
spontaneously, but grammatical intuitions may turn out to be inaccurate, often
due to an unforeseen construction or ambiguity. If a zero silence rate is
targeted, local grammars must be carefully tested. This is where a detailed
specification of what a grammar will do once applied to texts would be
necessary.

Abstract: Textual humor is enormously diverse and computational studies need to account
for this range, including intentionally bad humor. In this paper, we curate and
analyze a novel corpus of sentences from the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest to
better understand "bad" humor in English. Standard humor detection models
perform poorly on our corpus, and an analysis of literary devices finds that
these sentences combine features common in existing humor datasets (e.g., puns,
irony) with metaphor, metafiction and simile. LLMs prompted to synthesize
contest-style sentences imitate the form but exaggerate the effect by
over-using certain literary devices, and including far more novel
adjective-noun bigrams than human writers. Data, code and analysis are

Abstract: The history of the Korean language is characterized by a discrepancy between
its spoken and written forms and a pivotal shift from Chinese characters to the
Hangul alphabet. However, this linguistic evolution has remained largely
unexplored in NLP due to a lack of accessible historical corpora. To address
this gap, we introduce the Open Korean Historical Corpus, a large-scale, openly
licensed dataset spanning 1,300 years and 6 languages, as well as
under-represented writing systems like Korean-style Sinitic (Idu) and
Hanja-Hangul mixed script. This corpus contains 18 million documents and 5
billion tokens from 19 sources, ranging from the 7th century to 2025. We
leverage this resource to quantitatively analyze major linguistic shifts: (1)
Idu usage peaked in the 1860s before declining sharply; (2) the transition from
Hanja to Hangul was a rapid transformation starting around 1890; and (3) North
Korea's lexical divergence causes modern tokenizers to produce up to 51 times
higher out-of-vocabulary rates. This work provides a foundational resource for
quantitative diachronic analysis by capturing the history of the Korean
language. Moreover, it can serve as a pre-training corpus for large language
models, potentially improving their understanding of Sino-Korean vocabulary in
modern Hangul as well as archaic writing systems.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, despite large multilingual
training, struggle in out-of-domain and low-resource scenarios where labeled
data is scarce. We propose BEARD (BEST-RQ Encoder Adaptation with Re-training
and Distillation), a novel framework designed to adapt Whisper's encoder using
unlabeled data. Unlike traditional self-supervised learning methods, BEARD
uniquely combines a BEST-RQ objective with knowledge distillation from a frozen
teacher encoder, ensuring the encoder's complementarity with the pre-trained
decoder. Our experiments focus on the ATCO2 corpus from the challenging Air
Traffic Control (ATC) communications domain, characterized by non-native
speech, noise, and specialized phraseology. Using about 5,000 hours of
untranscribed speech for BEARD and 2 hours of transcribed speech for
fine-tuning, the proposed approach significantly outperforms previous baseline
and fine-tuned model, achieving a relative improvement of 12% compared to the
fine-tuned model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use a
self-supervised learning objective for domain adaptation of Whisper.

Abstract: Frontier AI agents show increasing promise as scientific research assistants,
and may eventually be useful for extended, open-ended research workflows.
However, in order to use agents for novel research, we must first assess the
underlying faithfulness and correctness of their work. To evaluate agents as
research assistants, we introduce ReplicationBench, an evaluation framework
that tests whether agents can replicate entire research papers drawn from the
astrophysics literature. Astrophysics, where research relies heavily on
archival data and computational study while requiring little real-world
experimentation, is a particularly useful testbed for AI agents in scientific
research. We split each paper into tasks which require agents to replicate the
paper's core contributions, including the experimental setup, derivations, data
analysis, and codebase. Each task is co-developed with the original paper
authors and targets a key scientific result, enabling objective evaluation of
both faithfulness (adherence to original methods) and correctness (technical
accuracy of results). ReplicationBench is extremely challenging for current
frontier language models: even the best-performing language models score under
20%. We analyze ReplicationBench trajectories in collaboration with domain
experts and find a rich, diverse set of failure modes for agents in scientific
research. ReplicationBench establishes the first benchmark of paper-scale,
expert-validated astrophysics research tasks, reveals insights about agent
performance generalizable to other domains of data-driven science, and provides
a scalable framework for measuring AI agents' reliability in scientific
research.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Autoformalization, which translates natural language mathematics into
machine-verifiable formal statements, is critical for using formal mathematical
reasoning to solve math problems stated in natural language. While Large
Language Models can generate syntactically correct formal statements, they
often fail to preserve the original problem's semantic intent. This limitation
arises from the LLM approaches' treating autoformalization as a simplistic
translation task which lacks mechanisms for self-reflection and iterative
refinement that human experts naturally employ. To address these issues, we
propose ReForm, a Reflective Autoformalization method that tightly integrates
semantic consistency evaluation into the autoformalization process. This
enables the model to iteratively generate formal statements, assess its
semantic fidelity, and self-correct identified errors through progressive
refinement. To effectively train this reflective model, we introduce
Prospective Bounded Sequence Optimization (PBSO), which employs different
rewards at different sequence positions to ensure that the model develops both
accurate autoformalization and correct semantic validations, preventing
superficial critiques that would undermine the purpose of reflection. Extensive
experiments across four autoformalization benchmarks demonstrate that ReForm
achieves an average improvement of 17.2 percentage points over the strongest
baselines. To further ensure evaluation reliability, we introduce
ConsistencyCheck, a benchmark of 859 expert-annotated items that not only
validates LLMs as judges but also reveals that autoformalization is inherently
difficult: even human experts produce semantic errors in up to 38.5% of cases.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have exhibited substantial
potential for parallel text generation, which may enable more efficient
generation compared to autoregressive models. However, current dLLMs suffer
from fixed generation lengths, which indicates the generation lengths of dLLMs
have to be determined before decoding as a hyper-parameter, leading to issues
in efficiency and flexibility. To solve these problems, in this work, we
propose to train a diffusion LLM with native variable generation lengths,
abbreviated as dLLM-Var. Concretely, we aim to train a model to accurately
predict the [EOS] token in the generated text, which makes a dLLM be able to
natively infer in a block diffusion manner, while still maintaining the ability
of global bi-directional (full) attention and high parallelism. Experiments on
standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a 30.1x speedup over
traditional dLLM inference paradigms and a 2.4x speedup relative to
autoregressive models such as Qwen and Llama. Our method achieves higher
accuracy and faster inference, elevating dLLMs beyond mere academic novelty and
supporting their practical use in real-world applications. Codes and models
have been released.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The quadratic cost of attention hinders the scalability of long-context LLMs,
especially in resource-constrained settings. Existing static sparse methods
such as sliding windows or global tokens utilizes the sparsity of attention to
reduce the cost of attention, but poorly adapts to the content-dependent
variations in attention due to their staticity. While previous work has
proposed several dynamic approaches to improve flexibility, they still depend
on predefined templates or heuristic mechanisms. Such strategies reduce
generality and prune tokens that remain contextually important, limiting their
accuracy across diverse tasks. To tackle these bottlenecks of existing methods
for long-context modeling, we introduce Dynamic Hierarchical Sparse Attention
(DHSA), a data-driven framework that dynamically predicts attention sparsity
online without retraining. Our proposed DHSA adaptively segments sequences into
variable-length chunks, then computes chunk representations by aggregating the
token embeddings within each chunk. To avoid the bias introduced by varying
chunk lengths, we apply length-normalized aggregation that scales the averaged
embeddings by the square root of the chunk size. Finally, DHSA upsamples the
chunk-level similarity scores to token level similarities to calculate
importance scores that determine which token-level interactions should be
preserved. Our experiments on Gemma2 with Needle-in-a-Haystack Test and
LongBench show that DHSA matches dense attention in accuracy, while reducing
prefill latency by 20-60% and peak memory usage by 35%. Compared to other
representative baselines such as block sparse attention, DHSA achieves
consistently higher accuracy (6-18% relative gains) with comparable or lower
cost, offering an efficient and adaptable solution for long-context on-device
LLMs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: With the release of new large language models (LLMs) like Llama and Mistral,
zero-shot cross-lingual transfer has become increasingly feasible due to their
multilingual pretraining and strong generalization capabilities. However,
adapting these decoder-only LLMs to new tasks across languages remains
challenging. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PeFT) techniques like
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) are widely used, prefix-based techniques such as
soft prompt tuning, prefix tuning, and Llama Adapter are less explored,
especially for zero-shot transfer in decoder-only models. We present a
comprehensive study of three prefix-based methods for zero-shot cross-lingual
transfer from English to 35+ high- and low-resource languages. Our analysis
further explores transfer across linguistic families and scripts, as well as
the impact of scaling model sizes from 1B to 24B. With Llama 3.1 8B, prefix
methods outperform LoRA-baselines by up to 6% on the Belebele benchmark.
Similar improvements were observed with Mistral v0.3 7B as well. Despite using
only 1.23M learning parameters with prefix tuning, we achieve consistent
improvements across diverse benchmarks. These findings highlight the potential
of prefix-based techniques as an effective and scalable alternative to LoRA,
particularly in low-resource multilingual settings.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Scaling laws describe how language models improve with additional data,
parameters, and compute. While widely used, they are typically measured on
aggregate test sets. Aggregate evaluations yield clean trends but average over
heterogeneous subpopulations, obscuring performance disparities. We introduce
relative scaling laws, which track how performance gaps between test
distributions evolve with scale rather than focusing solely on absolute error.
Using 255 decoder-only Transformers trained under matched-compute (IsoFLOP)
budgets from $10^{18}$--$10^{20}$ FLOPs on standard pretraining datasets, we
find diverse trajectories: academic domains on MMLU converge toward parity;
regional English dialects shift depending on population size; and clusters of
AI risk behaviours split, with capability- and influence-related risks
increasing during pretraining while adversarial risks do not. These results
show that although scaling improves overall performance, it is not a universal
equalizer. To support further study, we release all model checkpoints from this
work to enable practitioners to measure relative alongside traditional scaling
laws, in order to better prioritize robustness challenges in light of the
bitter lesson.

Abstract: Maintaining mutual understanding is a key component in human-human

repair initiation in Dutch dialogues by integrating linguistic and prosodic
features grounded in Conversation Analysis. The results show that prosodic cues
complement linguistic features and significantly improve the results of
pretrained text and audio embeddings, offering insights into how different
features interact. Future directions include incorporating visual cues,
exploring multilingual and cross-context corpora to assess the robustness and
generalizability.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) have become essential for aligning large language models
(LLMs), serving as scalable proxies for human evaluation in both training and
inference. However, existing RMs struggle on knowledge-intensive and long-form
tasks, where evaluating correctness requires grounding beyond the model's
internal knowledge. This limitation hinders them from reliably discriminating
subtle quality differences, especially when external evidence is necessary. To
address this, we introduce OpenRM, a tool-augmented long-form reward model that
systematically judges open-ended responses by invoking external tools to gather
relevant evidence. We train OpenRM with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) on over 27K synthesized pairwise examples generated through a
controllable data synthesis framework. The training objective jointly
supervises intermediate tool usage and final outcome accuracy, incentivizing
our reward model to learn effective evidence-based judgment strategies.
Extensive experiments on three newly-collected datasets and two widely-used
benchmarks demonstrate that OpenRM substantially outperforms existing reward
modeling approaches. As a further step, we integrate OpenRM into both
inference-time response selection and training-time data selection. This yields
consistent gains in downstream LLM alignment tasks, highlighting the potential
of tool-augmented reward models for scaling reliable long-form evaluation.

Abstract: We ask where, and under what conditions, dyslexic reading costs arise in a
large-scale naturalistic reading dataset. Using eye-tracking aligned to
word-level features (word length, frequency, and predictability), we model how
each feature influences dyslexic time costs. We find that all three features
robustly change reading times in both typical and dyslexic readers, and that
dyslexic readers show stronger sensitivities to each, especially
predictability. Counterfactual manipulations of these features substantially
narrow the dyslexic-control gap by about one third, with predictability showing
the strongest effect, followed by length and frequency. These patterns align
with dyslexia theories that posit heightened demands on linguistic working
memory and phonological encoding, and they motivate further work on lexical
complexity and parafoveal preview benefits to explain the remaining gap. In
short, we quantify when extra dyslexic costs arise, how large they are, and
offer actionable guidance for interventions and computational models for
dyslexics.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework for training large language models
(LLMs) as diagnostic agents with reinforcement learning, enabling them to
manage multi-turn diagnostic processes, adaptively select examinations, and
commit to final diagnoses. Unlike instruction-tuned models trained on static
case summaries, our method acquires diagnostic strategies through interactive
exploration and outcome-based feedback. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) We
present DiagGym, a diagnostics world model trained with electronic health
records that emits examination outcomes conditioned on patient history and
recommended examination, serving as a virtual clinical environment for
realistic diagnosis training and evaluation; (ii) We train DiagAgent via
end-to-end, multi-turn reinforcement learning to learn diagnostic policies that
optimize both information yield and diagnostic accuracy; (iii) We introduce
DiagBench, a diagnostic benchmark comprising 750 cases with physician-validated
examination recommendations and 99 cases annotated with 973 physician-written
rubrics on diagnosis process; (iv) we demonstrate superior performance across
diverse diagnostic settings. DiagAgent significantly outperforms 10
state-of-the-art LLMs, including DeepSeek-v3 and GPT-4o, as well as two
prompt-engineered agents. In single-turn settings, DiagAgent achieves 9.34%
higher diagnostic accuracy and 44.03% improvement in examination recommendation
hit ratio. In end-to-end settings, it delivers 15.12% increase in diagnostic
accuracy and 23.09% boost in examination recommendation F1 score. In
rubric-based evaluation, it surpasses the next-best model, Claude-sonnet-4, by
7.1% in weighted rubric score. These findings indicate that learning policies
in interactive clinical environments confers dynamic and clinically meaningful
diagnostic management abilities unattainable through passive training alone.

Abstract: Human evaluation of machine translation is in an arms race with translation
model quality: as our models get better, our evaluation methods need to be
improved to ensure that quality gains are not lost in evaluation noise. To this
end, we experiment with a two-stage version of the current state-of-the-art
translation evaluation paradigm (MQM), which we call MQM re-annotation. In this
setup, an MQM annotator reviews and edits a set of pre-existing MQM
annotations, that may have come from themselves, another human annotator, or an
automatic MQM annotation system. We demonstrate that rater behavior in
re-annotation aligns with our goals, and that re-annotation results in
higher-quality annotations, mostly due to finding errors that were missed
during the first pass.

Abstract: Language agents have demonstrated remarkable potential in web search and
information retrieval. However, these search agents assume user queries are
complete and unambiguous, an assumption that diverges from reality where users
begin with incomplete queries requiring clarification through interaction. Yet
most agents lack interactive mechanisms during the search process, and existing
benchmarks cannot assess this capability. To address this gap, we introduce
InteractComp, a benchmark designed to evaluate whether search agents can
recognize query ambiguity and actively interact to resolve it during search.
Following the principle of easy to verify, interact to disambiguate, we
construct 210 expert-curated questions across 9 domains through a
target-distractor methodology that creates genuine ambiguity resolvable only
through interaction. Evaluation of 17 models reveals striking failure: the best
model achieves only 13.73% accuracy despite 71.50% with complete context,
exposing systematic overconfidence rather than reasoning deficits. Forced
interaction produces dramatic gains, demonstrating latent capability current
strategies fail to engage. Longitudinal analysis shows interaction capabilities
stagnated over 15 months while search performance improved seven-fold,
revealing a critical blind spot. This stagnation, coupled with the immediate
feedback inherent to search tasks, makes InteractComp a valuable resource for
both evaluating and training interaction capabilities in search agents. The
code is available at https://github.com/FoundationAgents/InteractComp.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant traction in medical
decision support systems, particularly in the
  context of medical question answering and role-playing simulations. A common
practice, Prompt-Based Role Playing (PBRP),
  instructs models to adopt different clinical roles (e.g., medical students,
residents, attending physicians) to simulate varied
  professional behaviors. However, the impact of such role prompts on model
reasoning capabilities remains unclear. This
  study introduces the RP-Neuron-Activated Evaluation Framework(RPNA) to
evaluate whether role prompts induce distinct,
  role-specific cognitive processes in LLMs or merely modify linguistic style.
We test this framework on three medical QA
  datasets, employing neuron ablation and representation analysis techniques to
assess changes in reasoning pathways. Our
  results demonstrate that role prompts do not significantly enhance the
medical reasoning abilities of LLMs. Instead, they
  primarily affect surface-level linguistic features, with no evidence of
distinct reasoning pathways or cognitive differentiation
  across clinical roles. Despite superficial stylistic changes, the core
decision-making mechanisms of LLMs remain uniform
  across roles, indicating that current PBRP methods fail to replicate the
cognitive complexity found in real-world medical
  practice. This highlights the limitations of role-playing in medical AI and
emphasizes the need for models that simulate genuine
  cognitive processes rather than linguistic imitation.We have released the
related code in the following repository:https:

Abstract: Self-improving systems require environmental interaction for continuous
adaptation. We introduce SPICE (Self-Play In Corpus Environments), a
reinforcement learning framework where a single model acts in two roles: a
Challenger that mines documents from a large corpus to generate diverse
reasoning tasks, and a Reasoner that solves them. Through adversarial dynamics,
the Challenger creates an automatic curriculum at the frontier of the
Reasoner's capability, while corpus grounding provides the rich,
near-inexhaustible external signal necessary for sustained improvement. Unlike
existing ungrounded self-play methods that offer more limited benefits, SPICE
achieves consistent gains across mathematical (+8.9%) and general reasoning
(+9.8%) benchmarks on multiple model families. Our analysis reveals how
document grounding is a key ingredient in SPICE to continuously generate its
own increasingly challenging goals and achieve them, enabling sustained
self-improvement.

Abstract: LLM-based search agents are increasingly trained on entity-centric synthetic
data to solve complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, prevailing training
methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) discard this rich entity
information, relying instead on sparse, outcome-based rewards. This critical
limitation renders them unable to distinguish informative "near-miss"
samples-those with substantially correct reasoning but a flawed final
answer-from complete failures, thus discarding valuable learning signals. We
address this by leveraging the very entities discarded during training. Our
empirical analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between the number of
ground-truth entities identified during an agent's reasoning process and final
answer accuracy. Building on this insight, we introduce Entity-aware Group
Relative Policy Optimization (E-GRPO), a novel framework that formulates a
dense entity-aware reward function. E-GRPO assigns partial rewards to incorrect
samples proportional to their entity match rate, enabling the model to
effectively learn from these "near-misses". Experiments on diverse
question-answering (QA) and deep research benchmarks show that E-GRPO
consistently and significantly outperforms the GRPO baseline. Furthermore, our
analysis reveals that E-GRPO not only achieves superior accuracy but also
induces more efficient reasoning policies that require fewer tool calls,
demonstrating a more effective and sample-efficient approach to aligning search
agents.

Abstract: Training large language model agents on tasks at the frontier of their
capabilities is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. We introduce a data
synthesis approach inspired by the educational theory of the Zone of Proximal
Development (ZPD), which defines this frontier as tasks an LLM cannot solve
alone but can master with guidance. To operationalize this, we present the
AgentFrontier Engine, an automated pipeline that synthesizes high-quality,
multidisciplinary data situated precisely within the LLM's ZPD. This engine
supports both continued pre-training with knowledge-intensive data and targeted
post-training on complex reasoning tasks. From the same framework, we derive
the ZPD Exam, a dynamic and automated benchmark designed to evaluate agent
capabilities on these frontier tasks. We train AgentFrontier-30B-A3B model on
our synthesized data, which achieves state-of-the-art results on demanding
benchmarks like Humanity's Last Exam, even surpassing some leading proprietary
agents. Our work demonstrates that a ZPD-guided approach to data synthesis
offers a scalable and effective path toward building more capable LLM agents.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have emerged as a transformative
approach for open-ended problem solving, with information seeking (IS) being a
core capability that enables autonomous reasoning and decision-making. While
prior research has largely focused on improving retrieval depth, we observe
that current IS agents often suffer from low search efficiency, which in turn
constrains overall performance. A key factor underlying this inefficiency is
the sparsity of target entities in training tasks, which limits opportunities
for agents to learn and generalize efficient search behaviors. To address these
challenges, we propose WebLeaper, a framework for constructing high-coverage IS
tasks and generating efficient solution trajectories. We formulate IS as a
tree-structured reasoning problem, enabling a substantially larger set of
target entities to be embedded within a constrained context. Leveraging curated
Wikipedia tables, we propose three variants for synthesizing IS tasks, Basic,
Union, and Reverse-Union, to systematically increase both IS efficiency and
efficacy. Finally, we curate training trajectories by retaining only those that
are simultaneously accurate and efficient, ensuring that the model is optimized
for both correctness and search performance. Extensive experiments on both
basic and comprehensive settings, conducted on five IS benchmarks, BrowserComp,
GAIA, xbench-DeepSearch, WideSearch, and Seal-0, demonstrate that our method
consistently achieves improvements in both effectiveness and efficiency over
strong baselines.

Abstract: Parallel thinking expands exploration breadth, complementing the deep
exploration of information-seeking (IS) agents to further enhance
problem-solving capability. However, conventional parallel thinking faces two
key challenges in this setting: inefficiency from repeatedly rolling out from
scratch, and difficulty in integrating long-horizon reasoning trajectories
during answer generation, as limited context capacity prevents full
consideration of the reasoning process. To address these issues, we propose
ParallelMuse, a two-stage paradigm designed for deep IS agents. The first
stage, Functionality-Specified Partial Rollout, partitions generated sequences
into functional regions and performs uncertainty-guided path reuse and
branching to enhance exploration efficiency. The second stage, Compressed
Reasoning Aggregation, exploits reasoning redundancy to losslessly compress
information relevant to answer derivation and synthesize a coherent final
answer. Experiments across multiple open-source agents and benchmarks
demonstrate up to 62% performance improvement with a 10--30% reduction in
exploratory token consumption.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: LLM-based web agents show immense promise for information seeking, yet their
effectiveness on long-horizon tasks is hindered by a fundamental trade-off in
context management. Prevailing ReAct-based agents suffer from context
saturation as they accumulate noisy, raw histories, while methods that fixedly
summarize the full history at each step risk the irreversible loss of critical
details. Addressing these, we introduce AgentFold, a novel agent paradigm
centered on proactive context management, inspired by the human cognitive
process of retrospective consolidation. AgentFold treats its context as a
dynamic cognitive workspace to be actively sculpted, rather than a passive log
to be filled. At each step, it learns to execute a `folding' operation, which
manages its historical trajectory at multiple scales: it can perform granular
condensations to preserve vital, fine-grained details, or deep consolidations
to abstract away entire multi-step sub-tasks. The results on prominent
benchmarks are striking: with simple supervised fine-tuning (without continual
pre-training or RL), our AgentFold-30B-A3B agent achieves 36.2% on BrowseComp
and 47.3% on BrowseComp-ZH. Notably, this performance not only surpasses or
matches open-source models of a dramatically larger scale, such as the
DeepSeek-V3.1-671B-A37B, but also surpasses leading proprietary agents like
OpenAI's o4-mini.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Public research results on large-scale supervised finetuning of AI agents
remain relatively rare, since the collection of agent training data presents
unique challenges. In this work, we argue that the bottleneck is not a lack of
underlying data sources, but that a large variety of data is fragmented across
heterogeneous formats, tools, and interfaces. To this end, we introduce the
agent data protocol (ADP), a light-weight representation language that serves
as an "interlingua" between agent datasets in diverse formats and unified agent
training pipelines downstream. The design of ADP is expressive enough to
capture a large variety of tasks, including API/tool use, browsing, coding,
software engineering, and general agentic workflows, while remaining simple to
parse and train on without engineering at a per-dataset level. In experiments,
we unified a broad collection of 13 existing agent training datasets into ADP
format, and converted the standardized ADP data into training-ready formats for
multiple agent frameworks. We performed SFT on these data, and demonstrated an
average performance gain of ~20% over corresponding base models, and delivers
state-of-the-art or near-SOTA performance on standard coding, browsing, tool
use, and research benchmarks, without domain-specific tuning. All code and data
are released publicly, in the hope that ADP could help lower the barrier to
standardized, scalable, and reproducible agent training.

Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) games require players to translate high-level semantic
actions into precise device manipulations using controllers and head-mounted
displays (HMDs). While humans intuitively perform this translation based on
common sense and embodied understanding, whether Large Language Models (LLMs)
can effectively replicate this ability remains underexplored. This paper
introduces a benchmark, ComboBench, evaluating LLMs' capability to translate
semantic actions into VR device manipulation sequences across 262 scenarios
from four popular VR games: Half-Life: Alyx, Into the Radius, Moss: Book II,
and Vivecraft. We evaluate seven LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o,
Gemini-1.5-Pro, LLaMA-3-8B, Mixtral-8x7B, and GLM-4-Flash, compared against
annotated ground truth and human performance. Our results reveal that while
top-performing models like Gemini-1.5-Pro demonstrate strong task decomposition
capabilities, they still struggle with procedural reasoning and spatial
understanding compared to humans. Performance varies significantly across
games, suggesting sensitivity to interaction complexity. Few-shot examples
substantially improve performance, indicating potential for targeted
enhancement of LLMs' VR manipulation capabilities. We release all materials at

Abstract: In this paper, we present our submissions to the unified WMT25 Translation
Evaluation Shared Task. For the Quality Score Prediction subtask, we create a
new generation of MetricX with improvements in the input format and the
training protocol, while for the Error Span Detection subtask we develop a new
model, GemSpanEval, trained to predict error spans along with their severities
and categories. Both systems are based on the state-of-the-art multilingual
open-weights model Gemma 3, fine-tuned on publicly available WMT data. We
demonstrate that MetricX-25, adapting Gemma 3 to an encoder-only architecture
with a regression head on top, can be trained to effectively predict both MQM
and ESA quality scores, and significantly outperforms its predecessor. Our
decoder-only GemSpanEval model, on the other hand, we show to be competitive in
error span detection with xCOMET, a strong encoder-only sequence-tagging
baseline. With error span detection formulated as a generative task, we
instruct the model to also output the context for each predicted error span,
thus ensuring that error spans are identified unambiguously.

Abstract: The transformation of unstructured legal contracts into standardized,
machine-readable formats is essential for automating financial workflows. The
Common Domain Model (CDM) provides a standardized framework for this purpose,
but converting complex legal documents like Credit Support Annexes (CSAs) into
CDM representations remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present
an extension of the CDMizer framework, a template-driven solution that ensures
syntactic correctness and adherence to the CDM schema during contract-to-CDM
conversion. We apply this extended framework to a real-world task, comparing
its performance with a benchmark developed by the International Swaps and
Derivatives Association (ISDA) for CSA clause extraction. Our results show that
CDMizer, when integrated with a significantly smaller, open-source Large
Language Model (LLM), achieves competitive performance in terms of accuracy and
efficiency against larger, proprietary models. This work underscores the
potential of resource-efficient solutions to automate legal contract
transformation, offering a cost-effective and scalable approach that can meet
the needs of financial institutions with constrained resources or strict data
privacy requirements.

Abstract: The pre-ranking stage plays a pivotal role in large-scale recommender systems
but faces an intrinsic trade-off between model expressiveness and computational
efficiency. Owing to the massive candidate pool and strict latency constraints,
industry systems often rely on lightweight two-tower architectures, which are
computationally efficient yet limited in estimation capability. As a result,
they struggle to capture the complex synergistic and suppressive relationships
among candidate items, which are essential for producing contextually coherent
and diverse recommendation lists. Moreover, this simplicity further amplifies
the Sample Selection Bias (SSB) problem, as coarse-grained models trained on
biased exposure data must generalize to a much larger candidate space with
distinct distributions.
  To address these issues, we propose \textbf{DUET} (\textbf{DU}al Model
Co-Training for \textbf{E}ntire Space C\textbf{T}R Prediction), a set-wise
pre-ranking framework that achieves expressive modeling under tight
computational budgets. Instead of scoring items independently, DUET performs
set-level prediction over the entire candidate subset in a single forward pass,
enabling information-aware interactions among candidates while amortizing the
computational cost across the set. Moreover, a dual model co-training mechanism
extends supervision to unexposed items via mutual pseudo-label refinement,
effectively mitigating SSB. Validated through extensive offline experiments and
online A/B testing, DUET consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
and achieves improvements across multiple core business metrics. At present,
DUET has been fully deployed in Kuaishou and Kuaishou Lite Apps, serving the
main traffic for hundreds of millions of users.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) struggles on long, structured financial
filings where relevant evidence is sparse and cross-referenced. This paper
presents a systematic investigation of advanced metadata-driven
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, proposing and evaluating a
novel, multi-stage RAG architecture that leverages LLM-generated metadata. We
introduce a sophisticated indexing pipeline to create contextually rich
document chunks and benchmark a spectrum of enhancements, including
pre-retrieval filtering, post-retrieval reranking, and enriched embeddings,
benchmarked on the FinanceBench dataset. Our results reveal that while a
powerful reranker is essential for precision, the most significant performance
gains come from embedding chunk metadata directly with text ("contextual
chunks"). Our proposed optimal architecture combines LLM-driven pre-retrieval
optimizations with these contextual embeddings to achieve superior performance.
Additionally, we present a custom metadata reranker that offers a compelling,
cost-effective alternative to commercial solutions, highlighting a practical
trade-off between peak performance and operational efficiency. This study
provides a blueprint for building robust, metadata-aware RAG systems for
financial document analysis.

Abstract: Most recommender systems treat timestamps as numeric or cyclical values,
overlooking real-world context such as holidays, events, and seasonal patterns.
We propose a scalable framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to
generate geo-temporal embeddings from only a timestamp and coarse location,
capturing holidays, seasonal trends, and local/global events. We then introduce
a geo-temporal embedding informativeness test as a lightweight diagnostic,
demonstrating on MovieLens, LastFM, and a production dataset that these
embeddings provide predictive signal consistent with the outcomes of full model
integrations. Geo-temporal embeddings are incorporated into sequential models
through (1) direct feature fusion with metadata embeddings or (2) an auxiliary
loss that enforces semantic and geo-temporal alignment. Our findings highlight
the need for adaptive or hybrid recommendation strategies, and we release a
context-enriched MovieLens dataset to support future research.

Abstract: The recent success of large language models (LLMs) has renewed interest in
whether recommender systems can achieve similar scaling benefits. Conventional
recommenders, dominated by massive embedding tables, tend to plateau as
embedding dimensions grow. In contrast, the emerging generative paradigm
replaces embeddings with compact Semantic ID (SID) sequences produced by
autoregressive Transformers. Yet most industrial deployments remain
proprietary, leaving two fundamental questions open: (1) Do the expected
scaling laws hold on public benchmarks? (2) What is the minimal post-training
recipe that enables competitive performance?
  We present MiniOneRec, to the best of our knowledge, the first fully
open-source generative recommendation framework, which provides an end-to-end
workflow spanning SID construction, supervised fine-tuning, and
recommendation-oriented reinforcement learning. We generate SIDs via a Residual
Quantized VAE and post-train Qwen backbones ranging from 0.5B to 7B parameters
on the Amazon Review dataset. Our experiments reveal a consistent downward
trend in both training and evaluation losses with increasing model size,
validating the parameter efficiency of the generative approach. To further
enhance performance, we propose a lightweight yet effective post-training
pipeline that (1) enforces full-process SID alignment and (2) applies
reinforcement learning with constrained decoding and hybrid rewards. Together,
these techniques yield significant improvements in both ranking accuracy and
candidate diversity.
