Unlike\ntraditional search engines that present results in ranked lists, GSEs shift\nusers' attention from sequential browsing to content-driven subjective\nperception, driving a paradigm shift in information retrieval. In this context,\nenhancing the subjective visibility of content through Generative Search Engine\nOptimization (G-SEO) methods has emerged as a new research focus. With the\nrapid advancement of Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG)\ntechniques, GSEs can now efficiently integrate text, images, audio, and video,\nproducing richer responses that better satisfy complex information needs.\nExisting G-SEO methods, however, remain limited to text-based optimization and\nfail to fully exploit multimodal data. To address this gap, we propose Caption\nInjection, the first multimodal G-SEO approach, which extracts captions from\nimages and injects them into textual content, integrating visual semantics to\nenhance the subjective visibility of content in generative search scenarios. We\nsystematically evaluate Caption Injection on MRAMG, a benchmark for MRAG, under\nboth unimodal and multimodal settings.
