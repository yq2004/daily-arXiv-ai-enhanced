Despite recent progress, like the visual autoregressive model that unifies text and image processing in a single transformer architecture, generating high-quality interleaved content remains challenging. Moreover, evaluations of these interleaved sequences largely remain underexplored, with existing benchmarks often limited by unimodal metrics that inadequately assess the intricacies of combined image-text outputs. To address these issues, we present RAG-IGBench, a thorough benchmark designed specifically to evaluate the task of Interleaved Generation based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG-IG) in open-domain question answering. RAG-IG integrates multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with retrieval mechanisms, enabling the models to access external image-text information for generating coherent multimodal content. Distinct from previous datasets, RAG-IGBench draws on the latest publicly available content from social platforms and introduces innovative evaluation metrics that measure the quality of text and images, as well as their consistency. Through extensive experiments with state-of-the-art MLLMs (both open-source and proprietary) on RAG-IGBench, we provide an in-depth analysis examining the capabilities and limitations of these models. Additionally, we validate our evaluation metrics by demonstrating their high correlation with human assessments. Models fine-tuned on RAG-IGBench's training set exhibit improved performance across multiple benchmarks, confirming both the quality and practical utility of our dataset.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been proposed as automated assessors, showing promising alignment with human annotations. Most prior studies have treated documents as fixed units, feeding their full content directly to LLM assessors. We investigate how text summarization affects the reliability of LLM-based judgments and their downstream impact on IR evaluation. Using state-of-the-art LLMs across multiple TREC collections, we compare judgments made from full documents with those based on LLM-generated summaries of different lengths. We examine their agreement with human labels, their effect on retrieval effectiveness evaluation, and their influence on IR systems' ranking stability. Our findings show that summary-based judgments achieve comparable stability in systems' ranking to full-document judgments, while introducing systematic shifts in label distributions and biases that vary by model and dataset.

This research presents a systematic framework for metadata enrichment using large language models (LLMs) to enhance document retrieval in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Our approach employs a comprehensive, structured pipeline that dynamically generates meaningful metadata for document segments, substantially improving their semantic representations and retrieval accuracy. Through extensive experiments, we compare three chunking strategies-semantic, recursive, and naive-and evaluate their effectiveness when combined with advanced embedding techniques. The results demonstrate that metadata-enriched approaches consistently outperform content-only baselines, with recursive chunking paired with TF-IDF weighted embeddings yielding an 82.5% precision rate compared to 73.3% for semantic content-only approaches. The naive chunking strategy with prefix-fusion achieved the highest Hit Rate@10 of 0.925. Our evaluation employs cross-encoder reranking for ground truth generation, enabling rigorous assessment via Hit Rate and Metadata Consistency metrics. These findings confirm that metadata enrichment enhances vector clustering quality while reducing retrieval latency, making it a key optimization for RAG systems across knowledge domains.

Despite their impressive effectiveness in many areas, RAG systems based solely on semantic similarity often fail to ensure factual accuracy in specialized domains, where terminological ambiguity can affect retrieval relevance. This study proposes an enhanced RAG architecture that integrates a factual signal derived from Entity Linking to improve the accuracy of educational question-answering systems in Italian. The system includes a Wikidata-based Entity Linking module and implements three re-ranking strategies to combine semantic and entity-based information: a hybrid score weighting model, reciprocal rank fusion, and a cross-encoder re-ranker. Experiments were conducted on two benchmarks: a custom academic dataset and the standard SQuAD-it dataset. Results show that, in domain-specific contexts, the hybrid schema based on reciprocal rank fusion significantly outperforms both the baseline and the cross-encoder approach, while the cross-encoder achieves the best results on the general-domain dataset. These findings confirm the presence of an effect of domain mismatch and highlight the importance of domain adaptation and hybrid ranking strategies to enhance factual precision and reliability in retrieval-augmented generation. They also demonstrate the potential of entity-aware RAG systems in educational environments, fostering adaptive and reliable AI-based tutoring tools.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u589e\u5f3a\u7684RAG\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u5b9e\u4f53\u94fe\u63a5\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u610f\u5927\u5229\u8bed\u6559\u80b2\u95ee\u7b54\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7eaf\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u672f\u8bed\u6b67\u4e49\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u95ee\u7b54\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u589e\u5f3a\u7684RAG\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u57fa\u4e8eWikidata\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u94fe\u63a5\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e09\u79cd\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u6570\u52a0\u6743\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u4e92\u9006\u6392\u540d\u878d\u5408\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e92\u9006\u6392\u540d\u878d\u5408\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6848\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u800c\u5728\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ea4\u53c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u6392\u540d\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u589e\u5f3a\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5b9e\u4f53\u611f\u77e5RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In this study, we developed a chatbot for the University of Limerick's Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering to provide course information to students. A custom dataset of 1,203 question-answer pairs in SQuAD format was constructed using the university book of modules, supplemented with manually and synthetically generated entries. We fine-tuned BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) using PyTorch and evaluated performance with Exact Match and F1 scores. Results show that even modest fine-tuning improves hypothesis framing and knowledge extraction, demonstrating the feasibility of adapting foundation models to educational domains. While domain-specific BERT variants such as BioBERT and SciBERT exist for biomedical and scientific literature, no foundation model has yet been tailored to university course materials. Our work addresses this gap by showing that fine-tuning BERT with academic QA pairs yields effective results, highlighting the potential to scale towards the first domain-specific QA model for universities and enabling autonomous educational knowledge systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03BERT\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5229\u9ed8\u91cc\u514b\u5927\u5b66\u7535\u5b50\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5de5\u7a0b\u7cfb\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bfe\u7a0b\u4fe1\u606f\u95ee\u7b54\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u79d1\u5b66\u95ee\u7b54\u7cfb\u7edf\u591a\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u6559\u80b2\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u5927\u5b66\u8bfe\u7a0b\u6750\u6599\uff09\u7684\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u5230\u6559\u80b2\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u5b66\u8bfe\u7a0b\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b1,203\u4e2a\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\u7684SQuAD\u683c\u5f0f\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6e90\u4e8e\u5927\u5b66\u8bfe\u7a0b\u624b\u518c\uff0c\u5e76\u8f85\u4ee5\u4eba\u5de5\u548c\u5408\u6210\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u4f7f\u7528PyTorch\u5bf9BERT\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7cbe\u786e\u5339\u914d\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u9002\u5ea6\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u4e5f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u5047\u8bbe\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684BERT\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bfe\u7a0b\u4fe1\u606f\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5c06\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u5230\u6559\u80b2\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982BERT\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u5b66\u8bfe\u7a0b\u6750\u6599\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u95ee\u7b54\u6a21\u578b\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8\u81ea\u4e3b\u6559\u80b2\u77e5\u8bc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

While music information retrieval and computational musicology have explored structured and multimodal understanding, few resources support factual and contextual music question answering (MQA) grounded in artist metadata or historical context. We introduce MusWikiDB, a vector database of 3.2M passages from 144K music-related Wikipedia pages, and ArtistMus, a benchmark of 1,000 questions on 500 diverse artists with metadata such as genre, debut year, and topic. These resources enable systematic evaluation of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for MQA. Experiments show that RAG markedly improves factual accuracy; open-source models gain up to +56.8 percentage points (for example, Qwen3 8B improves from 35.0 to 91.8), approaching proprietary model performance. RAG-style fine-tuning further boosts both factual recall and contextual reasoning, improving results on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. MusWikiDB also yields approximately 6 percentage points higher accuracy and 40% faster retrieval than a general-purpose Wikipedia corpus.

Applying this method to a recently released corpus of proceedings of the Knesset, the Israeli parliament (in Hebrew), we find that the emotional style of members of government differs from that of opposition members; and that the level of affective polarization, as reflected by this style, is significantly increasing with time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u60c5\u611f\u98ce\u683c\u800c\u975e\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u7acb\u573a\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6781\u5316\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4ee5\u8272\u5217\u8bae\u4f1a\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u653f\u5e9c\u4e0e\u53cd\u5bf9\u6d3e\u60c5\u611f\u98ce\u683c\u5dee\u5f02\u4e14\u60c5\u611f\u6781\u5316\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\u5168\u7403\u6781\u5316\u8a00\u8bba\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u57fa\u4e8e\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u7acb\u573a\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u98ce\u683c\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u60c5\u611f\u6781\u5316", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6548\u4ef7\u3001\u5524\u9192\u5ea6\u548c\u652f\u914d\u5ea6\u4e09\u4e2a\u60c5\u611f\u7ef4\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\u60c5\u611f\u8bdd\u8bed\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4ee5\u6b64\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u60c5\u611f\u6781\u5316\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4ee5\u8272\u5217\u8bae\u4f1a\uff08\u5e0c\u4f2f\u6765\u8bed\uff09\u6700\u65b0\u8bed\u6599\u5e93", "result": "\u653f\u5e9c\u6210\u5458\u4e0e\u53cd\u5bf9\u6d3e\u6210\u5458\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u98ce\u683c\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u60c5\u611f\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u6781\u5316\u6c34\u5e73\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u60c5\u611f\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u6781\u5316\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u60c5\u611f\u6781\u5316\u5728\u653f\u6cbb\u8bdd\u8bed\u4e2d\u65e5\u76ca\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u653f\u6cbb\u6781\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2"}}

Although CoT examples facilitate reasoning, we noticed that their excessive inclusion during meta-training degrades performance when CoT supervision is limited. To mitigate such behavior, we propose CoT-Recipe, a formal approach to modulate the mix of CoT and non-CoT examples in meta-training sequences. We demonstrate that careful modulation via CoT-Recipe can increase the accuracy of transformers on novel tasks by up to 300% even when there are no CoT examples available in-context.

This wastes inference-time compute and can hurt accuracy. Existing attempts to stop early either manipulate decoding with extra sampling and heuristics, rely on auxiliary verifier models, or operate only as post-hoc analysis pipelines without formal guarantees. We introduce LYNX, an online early-exit mechanism that turns a model's own hidden-state awareness into confidence-controlled stopping decisions. LYNX attaches exit decisions to naturally occurring reasoning cues (e.g., \"hmm\", \"wait\") during generation, trains a lightweight probe on hidden states at those cue tokens using supervision from forced exits, and wraps the resulting scores in split conformal prediction to obtain distribution-free control over premature exits. Crucially, we train and calibrate this probe once on a generic mathematical corpus and reuse it unchanged across benchmarks, decoding temperatures, and even non-mathematical tasks. Across three model families spanning 1.5B to 32B parameters, a single mathematically trained probe per base model yields strong accuracy--efficiency tradeoffs. On GSM8K, LYNX matches or improves baseline accuracy while reducing tokens by 40--65\\%; on MATH-500 it improves accuracy by up to 12 points with roughly 35--60\\% fewer tokens; on AIME 2024 it recovers baseline accuracy with more than 50\\% token savings; and on CommonsenseQA, a non-math benchmark, it transfers zero-shot with modest accuracy gains and up to 70\\% fewer tokens. Compared to state-of-the-art early-exit methods, LYNX offers competitive or superior Pareto frontiers while remaining fully online, requiring no proxy models at inference, and providing explicit, user-tunable confidence guarantees.", "AI": {"tldr": "LYNX\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u7ebf\u65e9\u671f\u9000\u51fa\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u610f\u8bc6\u8fdb\u884c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u505c\u6b62\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7ecf\u5e38\"\u8fc7\u5ea6\u601d\u8003\"\uff1a\u5728\u5df2\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u4fe1\u606f\u56de\u7b54\u95ee\u9898\u540e\u4ecd\u7ee7\u7eed\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u6d6a\u8d39\u63a8\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u635f\u5bb3\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65e9\u671f\u505c\u6b62\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u8f85\u52a9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4ec5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e8b\u540e\u5206\u6790\u6d41\u7a0b\u800c\u6ca1\u6709\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "LYNX\u5c06\u9000\u51fa\u51b3\u7b56\u9644\u52a0\u5230\u81ea\u7136\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7ebf\u7d22\uff08\u5982\"hmm\"\u3001\"wait\"\uff09\u4e0a\uff0c\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ebf\u7d22\u6807\u8bb0\u5904\u4f7f\u7528\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a2\u9488\uff0c\u76d1\u7763\u6765\u81ea\u5f3a\u5236\u9000\u51fa\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u5272\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u5305\u88c5\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u5206\u6570\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u5bf9\u8fc7\u65e9\u9000\u51fa\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u65e0\u5173\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u9700\u5728\u901a\u7528\u6570\u5b66\u8bed\u6599\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u4e00\u6b21\u63a2\u9488\uff0c\u5373\u53ef\u8de8\u57fa\u51c6\u3001\u89e3\u7801\u6e29\u5ea6\u751a\u81f3\u975e\u6570\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u91cd\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u57281.5B\u523032B\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u5217\u4e0a\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u63a2\u9488\u4ea7\u751f\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027-\u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u5728GSM8K\u4e0a\u5339\u914d\u6216\u63d0\u9ad8\u57fa\u7ebf\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c1140-65%\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\uff1b\u5728MATH-500\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u8fbe12\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c1135-60%\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\uff1b\u5728AIME 2024\u4e0a\u6062\u590d\u57fa\u7ebf\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u540c\u65f6\u8282\u7701\u8d85\u8fc750%\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\uff1b\u5728\u975e\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6CommonsenseQA\u4e0a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7565\u6709\u63d0\u9ad8\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe70%\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u3002", "conclusion": "LYNX\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u9000\u51fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5b8c\u5168\u5728\u7ebf\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u660e\u786e\u7684\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u8c03\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study to uncover the distinguishing patterns of Pink Slime content and propose detection strategies based on these insights. Beyond traditional generation methods, we highlight a new adversarial vector: modifications through large language models (LLMs). Our findings reveal that even consumer-accessible LLMs can significantly undermine existing detection systems, reducing their performance by up to 40% in F1-score.

We challenge the naive assumption that linguistic change is simplification by quantitatively analyzing over 2,000 years of Sanskrit, demonstrating how weakly-supervised hybrid methods can yield new insights into the evolution of morphologically rich, low-resource languages. Our approach addresses data scarcity through weak supervision, using 100+ high-precision regex patterns to generate pseudo-labels for fine-tuning a multilingual BERT. We then fuse symbolic and neural outputs via a novel confidence-weighted ensemble, creating a system that is both scalable and interpretable. Applying this framework to a 1.47-million-word diachronic corpus, our ensemble achieves a 52.4% overall feature detection rate. Our findings reveal that Sanskrit's overall morphological complexity does not decrease but is instead dynamically redistributed: while earlier verbal features show cyclical patterns of decline, complexity shifts to other domains, evidenced by a dramatic expansion in compounding and the emergence of new philosophical terminology.

Despite many advantages, LM judges display concerning biases that can impair their integrity in evaluations. One such bias is self-preference: LM judges preferring their own answers over those produced by other LMs or humans. The bias is hard to eliminate as frontier LM judges can distinguish their own outputs from those of others, even when the evaluation candidates are not labeled with their sources. In this paper, we investigate strategies to mitigate self-preference by reducing the LM judges' ability to recognize their own outputs. We apply black-box perturbations to evaluation candidates in pairwise comparison to obfuscate the authorship and reduce self-recognition. We find that perturbations as simple as synonym replacement for a few words predictably reduce self-preference. However, we also uncover fundamental challenges to eliminating the bias: when we extrapolate our perturbations to a more complete neutralization of stylistic differences between the evaluation candidates, self-preference recovers. Our findings suggest that self-recognition and self-preference can happen on many semantic levels, and complete mitigation remains challenging despite promising initial results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6270\u52a8\u5019\u9009\u7b54\u6848\u6765\u6a21\u7cca\u4f5c\u8005\u8eab\u4efd\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u59d4\u8bc6\u522b\u81ea\u8eab\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7f13\u89e3\u81ea\u6211\u504f\u597d\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4f46\u5b8c\u5168\u6d88\u9664\u504f\u89c1\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u59d4\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u81ea\u6211\u504f\u597d\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5373\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u81ea\u5df1\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u800c\u975e\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u89c1\u96be\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u524d\u6cbf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u59d4\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u6807\u6ce8\u6765\u6e90\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9ed1\u76d2\u6270\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8bc4\u4f30\u5019\u9009\u7b54\u6848\u8fdb\u884c\u6270\u52a8\u4ee5\u6a21\u7cca\u4f5c\u8005\u8eab\u4efd\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u540c\u4e49\u8bcd\u66ff\u6362\u7b49\u6270\u52a8\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u81ea\u8eab\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6270\u52a8\uff08\u5982\u66ff\u6362\u5c11\u91cf\u8bcd\u8bed\u7684\u540c\u4e49\u8bcd\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u5730\u51cf\u5c11\u81ea\u6211\u504f\u597d\u3002\u4f46\u5f53\u5c06\u6270\u52a8\u5916\u63a8\u81f3\u66f4\u5f7b\u5e95\u5730\u6d88\u9664\u5019\u9009\u7b54\u6848\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u5dee\u5f02\u65f6\uff0c\u81ea\u6211\u504f\u597d\u4f1a\u91cd\u65b0\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u81ea\u6211\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u504f\u597d\u53ef\u80fd\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u9762\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u7136\u521d\u6b65\u7ed3\u679c\u4ee4\u4eba\u9f13\u821e\uff0c\u4f46\u5b8c\u5168\u7f13\u89e3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u59d4\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u504f\u597d\u504f\u89c1\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u81ea\u6211\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u504f\u597d\u53ef\u80fd\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u9762\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b8c\u5168\u6d88\u9664\u3002"}}

Prior works have shown that hallucinations can be reduced by iteratively critiquing and refining previously generated outputs using either the same model or a more powerful teacher model as the critique. However, these approaches either require additional test-time compute or assume access to more powerful teacher models, making them costly and less practical. In this work, we propose Self Critique and Refinement-based Preference Optimization (SCRPO), which is a self-supervised training framework that first constructs a preference dataset by leveraging the LLM's own critique and refinement capabilities, and then applies preference learning to improve the same LLM for faithful summarization. Experiments on three summarization benchmarks (XSUM CNNDM and SAMSum), demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods in terms of faithfulness metrics while either maintaining or improving other metrics that measure the overall quality of the summary.

However, existing low-bit quantization and sparsification techniques are difficult to balance accuracy and efficiency due to the limited hardware support. For example, W4A8 can only achieve the same peak TOPS as W8A8 whereas the GPU-supported sparse data format (2:4 semi-structure sparse) is seldomly adopted due to the loss of accuracy. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose the Sparse-Quantized Format (SQ-format), which is a unified data format for quantization and sparsification potentially easily supported by new hardware and existing GPUs. SQ-format makes use of the fact that sparse matrix can be accelerated in high-precision, and low-precision matrix multiplication can also be accelerated accordingly. As such, SQ-format is proposed to achieve Pareto improvement between performance and throughput. This format is particularly suitable for activations with outlier inequality status and makes their static compression possible. We show the state-of-the-art PTQ performance with SQ-format, propose the hardware required to support it, and further offer the design exploration and insights for the next-generation AI accelerators.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSQ-format\u7edf\u4e00\u6570\u636e\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u5177\u6709\u79bb\u7fa4\u503c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f20\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u6280\u672f\u7531\u4e8e\u786c\u4ef6\u652f\u6301\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002\u4f8b\u5982W4A8\u53ea\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0eW8A8\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u5cf0\u503cTOPS\uff0c\u800cGPU\u652f\u6301\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6570\u636e\u683c\u5f0f(2:4\u534a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7a00\u758f)\u7531\u4e8e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u5f88\u5c11\u88ab\u91c7\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7a00\u758f\u91cf\u5316\u683c\u5f0f(SQ-format)\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6570\u636e\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u77e9\u9635\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u800c\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f8\u5e94\u52a0\u901f\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u3002\u8be5\u683c\u5f0f\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u5177\u6709\u79bb\u7fa4\u503c\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f20\u91cf\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u9759\u6001\u538b\u7f29\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5c55\u793a\u4e86SQ-format\u5728PTQ\u4e0a\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u8be5\u683c\u5f0f\u6240\u9700\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3AI\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "SQ-format\u4e3a\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u53cb\u597d\u6570\u636e\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3AI\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

While pretrained language models (PLMs) have been employed for spell correction, their use is still limited to a handful of languages, and there has been no proper comparison across PLMs. We present the first empirical study on the effectiveness of PLMs for spell correction, which includes LRLs. We find that Large Language Models (LLMs) outperform their counterparts (encoder-based and encoder-decoder) when the fine-tuning dataset is large. This observation holds even in languages for which the LLM is not pre-trained. We release LMSpell, an easy- to use spell correction toolkit across PLMs. It includes an evaluation function that compensates for the hallucination of LLMs. Further, we present a case study with Sinhala to shed light on the plight of spell correction for LRLs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9996\u4e2a\u5173\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u62fc\u5199\u7ea0\u6b63\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u5927\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86LMSpell\u5de5\u5177\u5305\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u62fc\u5199\u7ea0\u6b63\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u867d\u7136\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u88ab\u7528\u4e8e\u62fc\u5199\u7ea0\u6b63\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4ecd\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5c11\u6570\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u9996\u4e2a\u5173\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u62fc\u5199\u7ea0\u6b63\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684PLMs\uff08\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u3001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1LMSpell\u5de5\u5177\u5305\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8bc4\u4f30\u51fd\u6570\u4ee5\u8865\u507fLLMs\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8f83\u5927\u65f6\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u57fa\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5bf9\u4e8eLLM\u672a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u4e5f\u662f\u5982\u6b64\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u50e7\u4f3d\u7f57\u8bed\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u62fc\u5199\u7ea0\u6b63\u7684\u56f0\u5883\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5728\u62fc\u5199\u7ea0\u6b63\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5145\u8db3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002LMSpell\u5de5\u5177\u5305\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8de8PLMs\u7684\u6613\u7528\u62fc\u5199\u7ea0\u6b63\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLMs\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u62fc\u5199\u7ea0\u6b63\u4ecd\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

However, as AI systems progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), such value systems may become insufficient. In addition, human feedback-based alignment remains resource-intensive and difficult to scale. While AI-feedback-based self-improving alignment methods have been explored as a scalable alternative, they have largely remained constrained to conventional alignment values. In this work, we explore both a more holistic alignment objective and a scalable, self-improving alignment approach. Aiming to transcend conventional alignment norms, we introduce Collective Agency (CA)-a unified and open-ended alignment value that encourages integrated agentic capabilities. We also propose Dynamic Alignment-an alignment framework that enables an LLM to iteratively align itself. Dynamic Alignment comprises two key components: (1) automated training dataset generation with LLMs, and (2) a self-rewarding mechanism, where the policy model evaluates its own output candidates and assigns rewards for GRPO-based learning.

We compared three supervised transformer-based encoders (BioClinicalModernBERT, ModernBERT, Clinical Longformer) against four generative LLM configurations (Llama 3.1-8B, GPT-4o, GPT-OSS-20b). We introduced a novel inference strategy using lesion-tagged inputs and anatomy-aware prompting to ground model reasoning. Performance was evaluated using class-specific F1-scores.\n  Results: The anatomy-informed GPT-OSS-20b model achieved the highest performance, yielding an incidentaloma-positive macro-F1 of 0.79. This surpassed all supervised baselines (maximum macro-F1: 0.70) and closely matched the inter-annotator agreement of 0.76. Explicit anatomical grounding yielded statistically significant performance gains across GPT-based models (p < 0.05), while a majority-vote ensemble of the top systems further improved the macro-F1 to 0.90. Error analysis revealed that anatomy-aware LLMs demonstrated superior contextual reasoning in distinguishing actionable findings from benign lesions.\n  Conclusion: Generative LLMs, when enhanced with structured lesion tagging and anatomical context, significantly outperform traditional supervised encoders and achieve performance comparable to human experts.

While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has shown promise, its linear structure often propagates errors, limiting overall effectiveness. To address this limitation, we present the a systematic study of Tree-of-Thought (ToT) reasoning for Bengali MWPs using the SOMADHAN dataset. Owing to computational and token-cost constraints, we evaluate a curated set of 100 representative problems across multiple large language models (LLMs), including GPT-OSS and LLaMA variants, under standard prompting, CoT, and ToT strategies. Our results show that CoT improves baseline accuracy from 78% (standard prompting) to 83% on average, while ToT further increases performance by up to 5 percentage points, achieving 88% accuracy with GPT-OSS-120B. These improvements highlight that ToT is particularly effective in medium-to-large-scale models but may offer less advantage for smaller ones. Overall, our findings establish ToT as a robust framework for solving mathematical problems in low-resource languages such as Bengali. More broadly, this study shows that structured reasoning methods like ToT can provide more reliable and globally consistent outcomes than CoT, paving the way for better reasoning strategies in multilingual NLP.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Tree-of-Thought\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\u6570\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0ToT\u76f8\u6bd4CoT\u80fd\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728GPT-OSS-120B\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523088%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u9898\u662fNLP\u4e2d\u6700\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u591a\u6b65\u6570\u503c\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u867d\u7136Chain-of-Thought\u63d0\u793a\u5df2\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7ebf\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u5bb9\u6613\u4f20\u64ad\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6574\u4f53\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528SOMADHAN\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u548ctoken\u6210\u672c\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff0c\u9009\u53d6100\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\u6570\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5305\u62ecGPT-OSS\u548cLLaMA\u53d8\u4f53\uff09\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u63d0\u793a\u3001CoT\u548cToT\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "CoT\u5c06\u57fa\u7ebf\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece78%\uff08\u6807\u51c6\u63d0\u793a\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u5230\u5e73\u574783%\uff0c\u800cToT\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5c06\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe5\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u5728GPT-OSS-120B\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523088%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002ToT\u5728\u4e2d\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7279\u522b\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u8f83\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u52bf\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "ToT\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\uff09\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982ToT\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6bd4CoT\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00NLP\u4e2d\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

Existing approaches are largely English-focused and primarily rely on distillation from general-purpose LLMs, raising concerns about the reliability of their medical knowledge. In this work, we present a method to generate multilingual reasoning traces grounded in factual medical knowledge. We produce 500k traces in English, Italian, and Spanish, using a retrievalaugmented generation approach over medical information from Wikipedia. The traces are generated to solve medical questions drawn from MedQA and MedMCQA, which we extend to Italian and Spanish. We test our pipeline in both in-domain and outof-domain settings across Medical QA benchmarks, and demonstrate that our reasoning traces improve performance both when utilized via in-context learning (few-shot) and supervised fine-tuning, yielding state-of-the-art results among 8B-parameter LLMs. We believe that these resources can support the development of safer, more transparent clinical decision-support tools in multilingual settings.

Code available at https://github.com/XD111ds/ILVR", "summary": "Interleaved reasoning paradigms enhance Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with visual feedback but are hindered by the prohibitive computational cost of repeatedly re-encoding pixel-dense images. A promising alternative, latent visual reasoning, circumvents this bottleneck yet currently forces a critical trade-off: methods either sacrifice precise perceptual modeling by over-compressing features or fail to model dynamic problems due to static, non-interleaved structures. We introduce Interleaved Latent Visual Reasoning (ILVR), a framework that unifies dynamic state evolution with precise perceptual modeling. ILVR interleaves textual generation with latent visual representations that act as specific, evolving cues for subsequent reasoning. To enable this, we employ a self-supervision strategy where a Momentum Teacher Model selectively distills relevant features from helper images into sparse supervision targets. This adaptive selection mechanism guides the model to autonomously generate context-aware visual signals. Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ILVR significantly outperforms existing approaches, effectively bridging the gap between fine-grained perception and sequential multimodal reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "ILVR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u9519\u6f5c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u91cd\u7f16\u7801\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u611f\u77e5\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u72b6\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4ea4\u9519\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u53cd\u9988\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u53cd\u590d\u91cd\u7f16\u7801\u50cf\u7d20\u5bc6\u96c6\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u3002\u800c\u6f5c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u56e0\u8fc7\u5ea6\u538b\u7f29\u7279\u5f81\u800c\u727a\u7272\u7cbe\u786e\u611f\u77e5\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u56e0\u9759\u6001\u975e\u4ea4\u9519\u7ed3\u6784\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "ILVR\u6846\u67b6\u4ea4\u9519\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u4f5c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u6f14\u5316\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u91cf\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u8f85\u52a9\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u63d0\u53d6\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u76d1\u7763\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u4e3b\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cILVR\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u5e8f\u5217\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "ILVR\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u72b6\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u4e0e\u7cbe\u786e\u611f\u77e5\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4ea4\u9519\u6f5c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

With powerful capabilities in personalized guidance, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution to bridge this gap. However, current research focuses mainly on one-on-one knowledge instruction, overlooking collaborative reasoning, a key skill for students developed in teamwork like ward rounds. To this end, we develop ClinEdu, a multi-agent pedagogical simulator with personality-driven patients and diverse student cohorts, enabling controlled testing of complex pedagogical processes and scalable generation of teaching data. Based on ClinEdu, we construct ClinTeach, a large Socratic teaching dialogue dataset that captures the complexities of group instruction. We then train MedTutor-R1, the first multimodal Socratic tutor designed for one-to-many instruction in clinical medical education. MedTutor-R1 is first instruction-tuned on our ClinTeach dataset and then optimized with reinforcement learning, using rewards derived from a three-axis rubric, covering structural fidelity, analytical quality, and clinical safety, to refine its adaptive Socratic strategies. For authentic in-situ assessment, we use simulation-based interactive evaluation that redeploys the tutor back into ClinEdu. Experimental results demonstrate that our MedTutor-R1 outperforms the base model by over 20% in average pedagogical score and is comparable to o3, while also exhibiting high adaptability in handling a varying number of students.

We provide a comparison of two models in three different settings for Czech Constitutional Court decisions: (i) a large general-purpose embedder (OpenAI), (ii) a domain-specific BERT-trained from scratch on ~30,000 decisions using sliding windows and attention pooling. We propose a noise-aware evaluation including IDF-weighted keyword overlap as graded relevance, binarization via two thresholds (0.20 balanced, 0.28 strict), significance via paired bootstrap, and an nDCG diagnosis supported with qualitative analysis. Despite modest absolute nDCG (expected under noisy labels), the general OpenAI embedder decisively outperforms the domain pre-trained BERT in both settings at @10/@20/@100 across both thresholds; differences are statistically significant. Diagnostics attribute low absolutes to label drift and strong ideals rather than lack of utility.

This fused metric is demonstrated to correlate more strongly with human judgements across all tested domains for faithfulness.

Conformal In-Context Learning (CICLe) has been proposed as a resource-efficient framework that integrates a lightweight base classifier with Conformal Prediction to guide LLM prompting by adaptively reducing the set of candidate classes. However, its broader applicability and efficiency benefits beyond a single domain have not yet been systematically explored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of CICLe across diverse NLP classification benchmarks. The results show that CICLe consistently improves over its base classifier and outperforms few-shot prompting baselines when the sample size is sufficient for training the base classifier, and performs comparably in low-data regimes. In terms of efficiency, CICLe reduces the number of shots and prompt length by up to 34.45% and 25.16%, respectively, and enables the use of smaller models with competitive performance.

Existing methods often rely on shallow cues (e.g., names or topics) to simulate authorial style, without robust evaluation. In this work, we present a training framework for style-conditioned story generation using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and a custom multi-reward setup. The style reward is derived from a fine-tuned sentence transformer using authorship verification (AV) signals, combined with content and completeness scores to stabilize long-form narrative generation. We conduct experiments using fiction by Mark Twain, a prominent 19th-century American author, with The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn serving as the reference style exemplar. Our 8B model outperforms larger baselines such as GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 4 in AV-style metrics, achieving a style score of 0.628 and competitive content quality. Results demonstrate the feasibility of agentic stylistic generation with moderate model size and task-specific training.

Using the ConvoKit Supreme Court Corpus (2010-2019), we analyze 12,663 speech chunks from advocate-justice interactions to assess whether interruptions alter the meaning of an advocate's argument and whether interruptions toward female advocates exhibit more negative emotional valence. Semantic shifts are quantified using GloVe-based sentence embeddings, while sentiment is measured through lexicon-based analysis. We find that semantic similarity between pre- and post-interruption speech remains consistently high, suggesting that interruptions do not substantially alter argumentative content. However, interruptions directed at female advocates contain significantly higher levels of negative sentiment. These results deepen empirical understanding of gendered communication in elite institutional settings and demonstrate the value of computational linguistic methods for studying power, discourse, and equity in judicial proceedings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u7f8e\u56fd\u6700\u9ad8\u6cd5\u9662\u53e3\u5934\u8fa9\u8bba\u4e2d\u6253\u65ad\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u5f8b\u5e08\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u8bed\u8c03\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u6027\u522b\u5dee\u5f02", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u6700\u9ad8\u6cd5\u9662\u53e3\u5934\u8fa9\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u6253\u65ad\u884c\u4e3a\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5f8b\u5e08\u7684\u8bba\u8bc1\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u6027\u522b\u52a8\u6001\u5728\u53f8\u6cd5\u8bdd\u8bed\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528ConvoKit\u6700\u9ad8\u6cd5\u9662\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff082010-2019\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u679012,663\u4e2a\u5f8b\u5e08-\u6cd5\u5b98\u4e92\u52a8\u7247\u6bb5\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528GloVe\u53e5\u5b50\u5d4c\u5165\u91cf\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bcd\u5178\u5206\u6790\u6d4b\u91cf\u60c5\u611f", "result": "\u6253\u65ad\u524d\u540e\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u4f4d\uff08\u6253\u65ad\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u8bba\u8bc1\u5185\u5bb9\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u9488\u5bf9\u5973\u6027\u5f8b\u5e08\u7684\u6253\u65ad\u5305\u542b\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u60c5\u611f", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u6df1\u5316\u4e86\u5bf9\u7cbe\u82f1\u673a\u6784\u4e2d\u6027\u522b\u5316\u6c9f\u901a\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u53f8\u6cd5\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e2d\u7684\u6743\u529b\u3001\u8bdd\u8bed\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4ef7\u503c"}}

Expert personas showed no consistent benefit across models, with few exceptions. Domain-mismatched expert personas sometimes degraded performance. Low-knowledge personas often reduced accuracy.

In this paper, we present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) based medical QA system that combines domain-specific knowledge retrieval with open-source LLMs to answer medical questions. We fine-tune two state-of-the-art open LLMs (LLaMA~2 and Falcon) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient domain specialization. The system retrieves relevant medical literature to ground the LLM's answers, thereby improving factual correctness and reducing hallucinations. We evaluate the approach on benchmark datasets (PubMedQA and MedMCQA) and show that retrieval augmentation yields measurable improvements in answer accuracy compared to using LLMs alone. Our fine-tuned LLaMA~2 model achieves 71.8% accuracy on PubMedQA, substantially improving over the 55.4% zero-shot baseline, while maintaining transparency by providing source references. We also detail the system design and fine-tuning methodology, demonstrating that grounding answers in retrieved evidence reduces unsupported content by approximately 60%.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates this limitation by enabling access to up-to-date, culturally grounded, and multilingual information; however, multilingual multimodal RAG remains largely underexplored. We introduce M4-RAG, a massive-scale benchmark covering 42 languages and 56 regional dialects and registers, comprising over 80,000 culturally diverse image-question pairs for evaluating retrieval-augmented VQA across languages and modalities. To balance realism with reproducibility, we build a controlled retrieval environment containing millions of carefully curated multilingual documents relevant to the query domains, approximating real-world retrieval conditions while ensuring consistent experimentation. Our systematic evaluation reveals that although RAG consistently benefits smaller VLMs, it fails to scale to larger models and often even degrades their performance, exposing a critical mismatch between model size and current retrieval effectiveness. M4-RAG provides a foundation for advancing next-generation RAG systems capable of reasoning seamlessly across languages, modalities, and cultural contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "M4-RAG\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d642\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u548c56\u79cd\u5730\u533a\u65b9\u8a00\uff0c\u5305\u542b8\u4e07\u591a\u4e2a\u6587\u5316\u591a\u6837\u56fe\u50cf-\u95ee\u9898\u5bf9\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u8bbf\u95ee\u6700\u65b0\u3001\u6587\u5316\u76f8\u5173\u548c\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u6a21\u6001RAG\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaM4-RAG\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b42\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u300156\u79cd\u65b9\u8a00\u76848\u4e07+\u6587\u5316\u591a\u6837\u56fe\u50cf-\u95ee\u9898\u5bf9\uff1b\u521b\u5efa\u53d7\u63a7\u68c0\u7d22\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u7cbe\u5fc3\u7b56\u5212\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6587\u6863\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff1aRAG\u5bf9\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21VLMs\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u76ca\u5904\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u751a\u81f3\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u679c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002", "conclusion": "M4-RAG\u4e3a\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u6587\u5316\u8bed\u5883\u4e2d\u65e0\u7f1d\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}
